Design Science:
• Design as an artifact: Design-science research must produce a viable artifact in the form of a construct, a model, a method, or an instantiation.
• Problem relevance: The objective of design-science research is to develop technology-based solutions to important and relevant business problems.
• Design evaluation: The utility, quality, and efficacy of a design artifact must be rigorously demonstrated via well-executed evaluation methods.
• Research contributions: Effective design-science research must provide clear and verifiable contributions in the areas of the design artifact, design foundations, and/or design methodologies.
• Research rigor: Design-science research relies upon the application of rigorous methods in both the construction and evaluation of the design artifact.
• Design as a search process: The search for an effective artifact requires utilizing available means to reach desired ends while satisfying laws in the problem environment.
• Communication of research: Design-science research must be presented effectively both to technology-oriented as well as management-oriented audiences.
