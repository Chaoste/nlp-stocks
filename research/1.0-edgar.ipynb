Our applications, platform and infrastructure offerings are delivered to customers worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models, including cloud-based,\\non-premise, or hybrid, which enable customer choice and flexibility. We market and sell our offerings globally to businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers with a\\nworldwide sales force positioned to offer the combinations that best meet customer needs.  Our Oracle Cloud offerings provide a comprehensive and\\nfully integrated stack of applications, platform, compute, storage and networking services in all three primary layers of the cloud: Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Our Oracle Cloud\\nSaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings (collectively, \\x93Oracle Cloud Services\\x94) integrate the software, hardware and services on customers\\x92 behalf in IT environments that we deploy, support and manage for the customer. Our integrated Oracle\\nCloud Services are designed to be rapidly deployable to enable customers shorter time to innovation; easily maintainable to reduce integration and testing work; connectable among differing deployment models to enable interchangeability and\\nextendibility between IT environments; compatible to easily move workloads between the Oracle Cloud and other IT environments; cost-effective by requiring lower upfront customer investment; and secure, standards-based and reliable. We are a leader\\nin the core technologies of cloud IT environments, including database and middleware software as well as enterprise applications, virtualization, clustering, large-scale systems management and related infrastructure. Our products and services are\\nthe building blocks of our Oracle Cloud Services, our partners\\x92 cloud services and our customers\\x92 cloud IT environments.  Our cloud\\nlicense and on-premise license deployment model includes Oracle Applications, Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware software offerings, among others, which customers deploy utilizing IT infrastructure\\nfrom the Oracle Cloud or their own cloud-based or on-premise IT environments. Substantially all customers, at their option, purchase license support contracts when they purchase a license. Our hardware\\nproducts include Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage and industry-specific products, among others, and customers generally opt to purchase hardware support contracts when they make a hardware purchase. We also offer services to assist our\\ncustomers and partners to maximize the performance of their Oracle purchases.  Providing choice and flexibility to our customers as to when and how\\nthey deploy our applications, platform and infrastructure technologies is an important element of our corporate strategy. We believe that offering customers broad, comprehensive, flexible and interoperable deployment models for our applications,\\nplatform and infrastructure technologies is important to our growth strategy and better addresses customer needs relative to our competitors, many of whom provide fewer offerings and more restrictive deployment models. \\nOur investments in, and innovation with respect to, our products and services that we offer through our cloud and license, hardware and services\\nbusinesses are another important element of our corporate strategy. In fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, we invested $6.1\\xa0billion, $6.2\\xa0billion and $5.8\\xa0billion, respectively, in research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of\\nofferings and products and to develop new technologies and services. We have a deep understanding as to how applications, platform and infrastructure technologies interact and function with one another. We focus our development efforts on improving\\nthe performance, security, operation and integration of our technologies to make them more cost-effective and easier to deploy, manage and maintain for our customers and to improve their computing performance relative to our competitors\\x92\\nproducts. For example, we believe that Oracle applications and platform technologies, such as the Oracle Database, when combined with Oracle infrastructure technologies deliver improved performance at a lower cost relative to competing\\ninfrastructure technologies. After the initial purchase of Oracle products and services, our customers can continue to benefit from our research and development efforts and deep IT expertise by electing to purchase and renew Oracle support offerings\\nfor their license and hardware deployments, which may include product enhancements that we periodically deliver to our products, and by renewing their Oracle Cloud Services contracts with us. \\n \\xa0 3 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n Our selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. We\\nbelieve that our acquisitions enhance the products and services that we can offer to customers, expand our customer base, provide greater scale to accelerate innovation, grow our revenues and earnings, and increase stockholder value. In recent\\nyears, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of companies, products, services and technologies that add to, are complementary to, or have otherwise enhanced our existing offerings. We expect to continue to acquire companies,\\nproducts, services and technologies to further our corporate strategy.

Our internal\\nmanufacturing operations consist primarily of materials procurement, assembly, testing and quality control of our Oracle Engineered Systems and certain of our enterprise and data center servers and storage products. For all other manufacturing, we\\ngenerally rely on third-party manufacturing partners to produce our hardware-related components and hardware products and we may involve our internal manufacturing operations in the final assembly, testing and quality control processes for these\\ncomponents and products. We distribute most of our hardware products either from our facilities or partner facilities. Our manufacturing processes are substantially based on standardization of components across product types, centralization of\\nassembly and distribution centers and a \\x93build-to-order\\x94 methodology in which products generally are built only after customers have placed firm orders.\\nProduction of our hardware products requires that we purchase materials, supplies, product subassemblies and full assemblies from a number of vendors. For most of our hardware products, we have existing alternate sources of supply or such sources\\nare readily available. However, we do rely on sole sources for certain of our hardware products. As a result, we continue to evaluate potential risks of disruption to our supply chain operations. Refer to \\x93Risk Factors\\x94 included in Item 1A\\nwithin this Annual Report for additional discussion of the challenges we encounter with respect to the sources and availability of supplies for our products and the related risks to our business. \\nSales and Marketing  We directly market and sell our\\ncloud, license, hardware and services offerings to businesses of many sizes and in many industries, government agencies and educational institutions. We also market and sell our offerings through indirect channels. No single customer accounted for\\n10% or more of our total revenues in fiscal 2018, 2017 or 2016.  In the United States, our sales and services employees are based in our\\nheadquarters and in field offices throughout the country. Outside the United States, our international subsidiaries sell, support and service our offerings in their local countries as well as within other foreign countries where we do not operate\\nthrough a direct sales subsidiary. Our geographic coverage allows us to draw on business and technical expertise from a global workforce, provides stability to our operations and revenue streams to offset geography specific economic trends and\\noffers us an opportunity to take advantage of new markets for our offerings. Our international operations subject us to certain risks, which are more fully described in \\x93Risk Factors\\x94 included in Item 1A of this Annual Report. A summary of\\nour domestic and international revenues and long-lived assets is set forth in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. \\nWe also market our product offerings worldwide through indirect channels. The companies that comprise our indirect channel network are members of the\\nOracle Partner Network. The Oracle Partner Network is a global program that manages our business relationships with a large, broad-based network of companies, including independent software and hardware vendors, system integrators and resellers that\\ndeliver innovative solutions and services based upon our product offerings. By offering our partners access to our product offerings, educational information, technical services, marketing and sales support, the Oracle Partner Network program\\nextends our market reach by providing our partners with the resources they need to be successful in delivering solutions to customers globally. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels including independent\\ndistributors and value-added resellers. \\n \\xa0 11 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n Research and Development \\nWe develop the substantial majority of our product offerings internally. In addition, we have extended our product offerings and intellectual property\\nthrough acquisitions of businesses and technologies. We also purchase or license intellectual property rights in certain circumstances. Internal development allows us to maintain technical control over the design and development of our products. We\\nhave a number of United States and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology. While we believe that our patents have value, no single patent is essential to us or to any of our principal\\nbusinesses. Research and development expenditures were $6.1\\xa0billion, $6.2\\xa0billion and $5.8\\xa0billion in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, or 15% of total revenues in fiscal 2018 and 16% of total revenues in each of fiscal 2017\\nand 2016. Rapid technological advances in hardware and software development, evolving standards in computer hardware and software technology, changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions, offerings and enhancements characterize the\\nmarkets in which we compete. We plan to continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development efforts to maintain and improve our current product and services offerings. \\nEmployees  As of May\\xa031, 2018, we employed\\napproximately 137,000 full-time employees, including approximately 39,000 in sales and marketing, approximately 18,000 in our cloud services and license support operations, approximately 4,000 in hardware, approximately 24,000 in services,\\napproximately 39,000 in research and development and approximately 13,000 in general and administrative positions. Of these employees, approximately 49,000 were employed in the United States and approximately 88,000 were employed internationally.\\nNone of our employees in the United States is represented by a labor union; however, in certain foreign subsidiaries, labor unions or workers\\x92 councils represent some of our employees. \\nSeasonality and Cyclicality  Our quarterly revenues have\\nhistorically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including the structure of our sales force incentive compensation plans, which are common in the technology industry. In each fiscal year, our total revenues and operating margins are\\ntypically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fiscal quarter. The operating margins of our businesses (in particular, our cloud and license business and hardware business) are generally affected by seasonal factors in a\\nsimilar manner as our revenues as certain expenses within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short term. See \\x93Selected Quarterly Financial Data\\x94 in Item 7 of this Annual Report for a more complete description of the seasonality\\nand cyclicality of our revenues, expenses and margins.  Competition \\nWe face intense competition in all aspects of our business. The nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving\\nas firms emerge, expand or are acquired, as technology evolves and as customer demands and competitive pressures otherwise change.  Our customers\\nare demanding less complexity and lower total cost in the implementation, sourcing, integration and ongoing maintenance of their enterprise software and hardware. Our enterprise cloud license and on-premise\\nlicense, and hardware offerings compete directly with certain offerings from some of the largest and most competitive companies in the world, including Amazon.com, Inc., Microsoft Corporation, International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), Intel\\nCorporation, Cisco Systems, Inc., Adobe Systems Incorporated, Alphabet Inc. and SAP SE, as well as other companies like Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, salesforce.com, inc. and Workday, Inc. In addition, due to the low barriers to entry in many of our\\nmarket segments, new technologies and new and growing competitors frequently emerge to challenge our offerings. Our competitors range from companies offering broad IT solutions across many of our lines of business to vendors providing point\\nsolutions, or offerings focused on a specific functionality, product area or industry. In addition, as we expand into new market segments, we face increased competition as we compete with existing competitors, as well as firms that may be partners\\nin other areas of our business and other firms with whom we have not previously competed. \\n \\xa0 12 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n \\nMoreover, we or our competitors may take certain strategic actions\\x97including acquisitions, partnerships and joint ventures, or repositioning of product lines\\x97which invite even greater\\ncompetition in one or more product offering categories.  Key competitive factors in each of the segments in which we currently compete and may\\ncompete in the future include: total cost of ownership, performance, scalability, reliability, security, functionality, efficiency, speed to production and quality of technical support. Our product and service sales (and the relative strength of our\\nproducts and services versus those of our competitors) are also directly and indirectly affected by the following, among other things:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the adoption of cloud-based IT offerings including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n ease of deployment, use and maintenance of our products and services offerings; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n compatibility between Oracle products and services deployed within local IT environments and public cloud IT\\nenvironments, including our Oracle Cloud environments;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the adoption of commodity servers and microprocessors; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the broader \\x93platform\\x94 competition between our industry standard Java technology platform and the .NET\\nprogramming environment of Microsoft;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n operating system competition among our Oracle Solaris and Linux operating systems, with alternatives including\\nMicrosoft\\x92s Windows Server, and other UNIX and Linux operating systems;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the adoption of open source alternatives to commercial software by enterprise software customers;\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n products, features and functionality developed internally by customers and their IT staff; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n products, features and functionality customized and implemented for customers by consultants, systems integrators or\\nother third parties; and  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n attractiveness of offerings from business processing outsourcers. \\nFor more information about the competitive risks we face, refer to Item\\xa01A. \\x93Risk Factors\\x94 included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\\n Available Information  Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and\\n15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are available, free of charge, on our Investor Relations website at www.oracle.com/investor as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it\\nto, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Item 1A.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Risk\\nFactors  We operate in rapidly changing economic and technological environments that present numerous risks, many of which are driven by\\nfactors that we cannot control or predict. The following discussion, as well as our \\x93Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\x94 discussion in Management\\x92s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item\\n7), highlights some of these risks. The risks described below are not exhaustive and you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our securities. \\nOur Oracle Cloud strategy, including our Oracle Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)\\nand Data as a Service (DaaS) offerings, may adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We provide our cloud and other offerings to customers worldwide via deployment models that best suit their needs, including\\nvia our cloud-based SaaS, PaaS, IaaS and DaaS offerings. As these business \\n \\xa0 14 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n \\nmodels continue to evolve, we may not be able to compete effectively, generate significant revenues or maintain the profitability of our cloud offerings. Additionally, the increasing prevalence\\nof cloud and SaaS delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our cloud and license offerings. If we do not successfully execute our cloud computing strategy or anticipate the cloud computing needs of our\\ncustomers, our reputation as a cloud services provider could be harmed and our revenues and profitability could decline.  As customer demand for\\nour cloud offerings increases, we experience volatility in our reported revenues and operating results due to the differences in timing of revenue recognition between our cloud license and on-premise license,\\nand hardware arrangements relative to our cloud offering arrangements. Customers generally purchase our cloud offerings on a subscription basis and revenues from these offerings are generally recognized ratably over the terms of the subscriptions.\\nConsequently, any deterioration in sales activity associated with our cloud offerings may not be immediately observable in our consolidated statement of operations. This is in contrast to revenues associated with our cloud license and on-premise license arrangements which are generally recognized in full at the time of delivery of the related licenses. In addition, we incur certain expenses associated with the infrastructure and marketing of our\\ncloud offerings in advance of our ability to recognize the revenues associated with these offerings.  We have also acquired a number of cloud\\ncomputing companies, and the integration of these companies into our Oracle Cloud strategy may not be as efficient or scalable as anticipated, which could adversely affect our ability to fully realize the benefits anticipated from these\\nacquisitions.  Our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and services, integrate acquired products and services and\\nenhance our existing products and services.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Rapid technological advances, changing delivery models and evolving standards in computer hardware and software development and communications infrastructure,\\nchanging and increasingly sophisticated customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements characterize the industries in which we compete. If we are unable to develop new or sufficiently differentiated products and services,\\nenhance and improve our product offerings and support services in a timely manner or position and price our products and services to meet demand, customers may not purchase or subscribe to our software, hardware or cloud offerings or renew software\\nsupport, hardware support or cloud subscriptions contracts. Renewals of these contracts are important to the growth of our business. In addition, we cannot provide any assurance that the standards on which we choose to develop new products will\\nallow us to compete effectively for business opportunities in emerging areas.  We have continued to refresh and release new offerings of our cloud\\nproducts and services, including the launch of the Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud Service in fiscal 2018. The Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud Service offers automation based on machine learning and we have guaranteed, among other\\nmatters, that it will reduce customer downtime to less than 30 minutes a year and that Amazon Data Warehouse customers will see a significant cost reduction if they migrate their workloads to our offering. Machine learning and artificial\\nintelligence are increasingly driving innovations in technology but if they fail to operate as anticipated or the Oracle Autonomous Warehouse Cloud Service or our other products do not perform as promised, our business and reputation may be harmed.\\n In addition, our business may be adversely affected if:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we do not continue to develop and release new or enhanced products and services within the anticipated time frames;\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n there is a delay in market acceptance of new, enhanced or acquired product lines or services; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n there are changes in information technology (IT) trends that we do not adequately anticipate or address with our\\nproduct development efforts;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we do not timely optimize complementary product lines and services; or \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we fail to adequately integrate, support or enhance acquired product lines or services. \\nWe might experience significant coding, manufacturing or configuration errors in our cloud, license and hardware\\nofferings.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Despite testing prior to the release and throughout the lifecycle of a product or service, \\n \\xa0 15 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n \\nour cloud, license and hardware offerings sometimes contain coding or manufacturing errors that can impact their function, performance and security, and result in other negative consequences. The\\ndetection and correction of any errors in released cloud, license or hardware offerings can be time consuming and costly. Errors in our cloud, license or hardware offerings could affect their ability to properly function or operate with other cloud,\\nlicense or hardware offerings, could delay the development or release of new products or services or new versions of products or services, could create security vulnerabilities in our products or services, and could adversely affect market\\nacceptance of our products or services. This includes third-party software products or services incorporated into our own. If we experience errors or delays in releasing our cloud, license or hardware offerings or new versions thereof, our sales\\ncould be affected and revenues could decline. In addition, we run Oracle\\x92s business operations as well as cloud and other services that we offer to our customers on our products and networks. Therefore, any flaws could affect our ability to\\nconduct our business operations and the operations of our customers. Enterprise customers rely on our cloud, license and hardware offerings and related services to run their businesses and errors in our cloud, license and hardware offerings and\\nrelated services could expose us to product liability, performance and warranty claims as well as significant harm to our brand and reputation, which could impact our future sales. \\nIf our security measures for our products and services are compromised and as a result, our data, our customers\\x92 data or our IT systems are\\naccessed improperly, made unavailable, or improperly modified, our products and services may be perceived as vulnerable, our brand and reputation could be damaged, the IT services we provide to our customers could be disrupted, and customers may\\nstop using our products and services, all of which could reduce our revenue and earnings, increase our expenses and expose us to legal claims and regulatory actions.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We are in the IT business, and our products and\\nservices, including our Oracle Cloud Services, store, retrieve, manipulate and manage our customers\\x92 information and data, external data, as well as our own data. We have a reputation for secure and reliable product offerings and related\\nservices and we have invested a great deal of time and resources in protecting the integrity and security of our products, services and the internal and external data that we manage. At times, we encounter attempts by third parties (which may\\ninclude individuals or groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, such as state-sponsored organizations, nation states and individuals sponsored by them) to identify and exploit product and service vulnerabilities, penetrate or bypass our\\nsecurity measures, and gain unauthorized access to our or our customers\\x92, partners\\x92 and suppliers\\x92 software, hardware and cloud offerings, networks and systems, any of which could lead to the compromise of personal information or the\\nconfidential information or data of Oracle or our customers. Computer hackers and others may be able to develop and deploy IT related viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that could attack our networks, systems, products and\\nservices, exploit potential security vulnerabilities of our networks, systems, products and services, create system disruptions and cause shutdowns or denials of service. This is also true for third-party data, products or services incorporated into\\nour own. Data may also be accessed or modified improperly as a result of customer, partner, employee or supplier error or malfeasance and third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce customers, partners, employees or suppliers into disclosing\\nsensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our data, our customers\\x92, suppliers\\x92 or partners\\x92 data or the IT systems of Oracle, our customers, suppliers or partners. \\nSecurity industry experts and government officials have warned about the risks of hackers and cyber-attacks targeting IT products and businesses.\\nAlthough this is an industry-wide problem that affects software and hardware companies generally, it affects Oracle in particular because computer hackers tend to focus their efforts on the most prominent IT companies, and they may focus on Oracle\\nbecause of our reputation for, and marketing efforts associated with, having secure products and services. These risks will increase as we continue to grow our cloud offerings and store and process increasingly large amounts of data, including\\npersonal information and our customers\\x92 confidential information and data and other external data, and host or manage parts of our customers\\x92 businesses in cloud-based IT environments, especially in customer sectors involving particularly\\nsensitive data such as health sciences, financial services, retail, hospitality and the government. We also have an active acquisition program and have acquired a number of companies, products, services and technologies over the years. While we make\\nsignificant efforts to address any IT security issues with respect to our acquired companies, we may still inherit such risks when we integrate these companies within Oracle. \\n \\xa0 16 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or sabotage IT systems change frequently,\\ngrow more complex over time, and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate or implement adequate measures to prevent against such techniques. Our\\ninternal IT systems continue to evolve and we are often early adapters of new technologies. However, our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as\\nnew threats emerge. In addition, we may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach. \\nWe could suffer significant damage to our brand and reputation if a cyber-attack or other security incident were to allow unauthorized access to or\\nmodification of our customers\\x92 or suppliers\\x92 data, other external data, or our own data or our IT systems or if the services we provide to our customers were disrupted, or if our products or services are perceived as having security\\nvulnerabilities. Customers could lose confidence in the security and reliability of our products and services, including our cloud offerings, and perceive them to be not secure. This could lead to fewer customers using our products and services and\\nresult in reduced revenue and earnings. The costs we would incur to address and fix these security incidents would increase our expenses. These types of security incidents could also lead to loss or destruction of information, inappropriate use of\\nproprietary and sensitive data, lawsuits, indemnity obligations, regulatory investigations and financial penalties, and claims and increased legal liability, including in some cases contractual costs related to customer notification and fraud\\nmonitoring.  As illustrated by the Spectre and Meltdown threats, our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and\\ncomponents across a broad ecosystem. If there is a security vulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, we could face increased costs, liability claims, customer dissatisfaction, reduced revenue, or\\nharm to our reputation or competitive position.  Our business practices with respect to data could give rise to operational interruption,\\nliabilities or reputational harm as a result of governmental regulation, legal requirements or industry standards relating to consumer privacy and data protection.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0As regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to\\nincrease and worldwide laws and regulations concerning the handling of personal information expand and become more complex, potential risks related to data collection and use within our business will intensify. For example, the European Union (EU)\\nand the United States (U.S.) formally entered into a new framework in July 2016 that provides a mechanism for companies to transfer data from EU member states to the U.S. This new framework, called the Privacy Shield, is intended to address\\nshortcomings identified by the Court of Justice of the EU in the previous EU-U.S. Safe Harbor Framework, which the Court of Justice invalidated in October 2015. The Privacy Shield and other data transfer\\nmechanisms are currently subject to challenges in European courts, which may lead to uncertainty about the legal basis for data transfers to the U.S. or interruption of such transfers. In the event any court blocks transfers to or from a particular\\njurisdiction on the basis that no transfer mechanisms are legally adequate, this could give rise to operational interruption in the performance of services for customers and internal processing of employee information, regulatory liabilities or\\nreputational harm.  In addition, U.S. and foreign governments have enacted or are considering enacting legislation or regulations, or may in the\\nnear future interpret existing legislation or regulations, in a manner that could significantly impact our ability, as well as the ability of our customers, partners and data providers, to collect, augment, analyze, use, transfer and share personal\\nand other information that is integral to certain services we provide. This could be true particularly in those jurisdictions where privacy laws or regulators take a broader view of how personal information is defined, therefore subjecting the\\nhandling of such data to heightened restrictions that may be obstructive to our operations and the operations of our customers, partners and data providers. This impact may be acute in countries that have passed or are considering passing\\nlegislation that requires data to remain localized \\x93in country,\\x94 as this imposes financial costs on any service provider that is required to store data in jurisdictions not of its choosing and nonstandard operational processes that are\\ndifficult and costly to integrate with global processes.  Regulators globally are also imposing greater monetary fines for privacy violations. For\\nexample, in 2016, the EU adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became effective in May 2018. The law establishes new requirements regarding the handling of personal data. Non-compliance\\nwith the GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue. The GDPR and other changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of personal and other types of data could greatly increase\\n\\n \\xa0 17 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n \\nthe size of potential fines related to data protection and our cost of providing our products and services could result in changes to our business practices or even prevent us from offering\\ncertain services in jurisdictions in which we operate. Although we have implemented contracts, policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors,\\npartners, data providers or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our contracts, policies and procedures. Additionally, public perception and standards related to the privacy of personal information can shift rapidly, in ways that may\\naffect our reputation or influence regulators to enact regulations and laws that may limit our ability to provide certain products.  We make\\nstatements about our use and disclosure of personal information through our privacy policy, information provided on our website and press statements. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with these public statements or with U.S.\\nfederal, state, or foreign laws and regulations, including laws and regulations regulating privacy, data security, or consumer protection, public perception, standards, self-regulatory requirements or legal obligations, could result in lost or\\nrestricted business, proceedings, actions or fines brought against us or levied by governmental entities or others, or could adversely affect our business and harm our reputation. \\nEconomic, political and market conditions can adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue\\ngrowth and profitability, which in turn could adversely affect our stock price.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our business is influenced by a range of factors that are beyond our control and that we have no comparative advantage in forecasting.\\nThese include:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n general economic and business conditions; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n overall demand for enterprise cloud, license and hardware products and services; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n governmental budgetary constraints or shifts in government spending priorities; and \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n general legal, regulatory and political developments. \\nMacroeconomic developments like the developments associated with the United Kingdom\\x92s vote to exit the EU or the occurrence of similar events in\\nother countries that lead to uncertainty or instability in economic, political or market conditions could negatively affect our business, operating results, financial condition and outlook, which, in turn, could adversely affect our stock price. Any\\ngeneral weakening of, and related declining corporate confidence in, the global economy or the curtailment of government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce or eliminate their IT budgets and spending, which\\ncould cause customers to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services or cause customers not to pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services. \\nIn addition, international, regional or domestic political unrest and the related potential impact on global stability, terrorist attacks and the\\npotential for other hostilities in various parts of the world, potential public health crises and natural disasters continue to contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that could adversely affect our results of operations and\\nfinancial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability. These factors generally have the strongest effect on our sales of cloud license and on-premise license, hardware and related services and,\\nto a lesser extent, also may affect our renewal rates for license support and our subscription-based cloud offerings.  If we are unable to\\ncompete effectively, the results of operations and prospects for our business could be harmed.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We face intense competition in all aspects of our business. The nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape\\nthat is constantly evolving as firms emerge, expand or are acquired, as technology evolves and as delivery models change. Many vendors spend amounts in excess of what Oracle spends to develop and market applications, platform and infrastructure\\ntechnologies including databases, middleware products, application development tools, business applications, collaboration products and business intelligence products, among others, which compete with Oracle applications, platform and infrastructure\\nofferings. Use of our competitors\\x92 technologies may influence a customer\\x92s purchasing decision or create an environment that makes it less efficient to utilize Oracle products and services. Our competition may also adopt business practices\\nthat provide customers access to competing products and services at a risk profile that we may not generally find acceptable, which may convince customers to purchase competitor products and services. We could lose\\n\\n \\xa0 18 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n \\ncustomers if our competitors introduce new competitive products, add new functionality, acquire competitive products, reduce prices, better execute on their sales and marketing strategies, offer\\nmore flexible business practices or form strategic alliances with other companies. We may also face increasing competition from open source software initiatives in which competitors may provide software and intellectual property for free. Existing\\nor new competitors could gain sales opportunities or customers at our expense.  Our hardware business competes with, among others, (1)\\xa0systems\\nmanufacturers and resellers of systems based on our own microprocessors and operating systems and those of our competitors, (2)\\xa0microprocessor/chip manufacturers, (3)\\xa0providers of storage products, (4)\\xa0certain industry-specific\\nhardware manufacturers including those serving communications, hospitality and retail industries and (5)\\xa0certain cloud providers that build their own IT infrastructures. Our hardware business causes us to compete with certain companies that\\nhistorically have been partners. Some of these competitors may have more experience than we do in managing a hardware business. Certain of these competitors also compete very aggressively on price. A loss in our competitive position could result in\\nlower revenues or profitability, which could adversely impact our ability to realize the revenue and profitability forecasts for our hardware business. \\nWe may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The intense competition we face in the sales of\\nour products and services and general economic and business conditions can put pressure on us to change our prices. If our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the marketplace considers more\\nvaluable, we may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully. Any such changes may reduce margins and could adversely affect operating results. Additionally, the increasing prevalence of cloud delivery models\\noffered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our other cloud and license, hardware and services offerings, in particular our IaaS offerings, which could reduce our revenues and profitability. Our license support fees and\\nhardware support fees are generally priced as a percentage of our net cloud license and on-premise license fees and net new hardware products fees, respectively. Our competitors may offer lower pricing on\\ntheir support offerings, which could put pressure on us to further discount our offerings or support pricing.  We introduced Oracle Bring Your Own\\nLicense (BYOL) to PaaS and Universal Credit Pricing in fiscal 2018 to simplify the way customers purchase and consume our cloud services. Oracle BYOL enables customers to maintain their existing software licenses for Oracle PaaS while expanding\\ntheir platform technology footprint at a discounted price. Oracle Universal Credit Pricing provides a flexible model for customers to access Oracle PaaS and IaaS services on demand via a single contract. These changes and any future changes to our\\nprices and pricing policies could cause our revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies. Some of our competitors may bundle products for promotional purposes or as a long-term\\npricing strategy, commit to large customer deployments at prices that are unprofitable, or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations. These practices could, over time, significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for certain\\nof our products. If we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of our products or changes in customer demand, our revenues could decrease. The increase in open source software distribution may also cause us to change our\\npricing models.  Our international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating\\nresults.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from, and have significant operations, outside of the U.S. Our international operations include cloud operations, cloud, software and hardware development,\\nmanufacturing, assembly, sales, customer support, consulting and other services and shared administrative service centers.  Compliance with\\ninternational and U.S.\\xa0laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations include U.S.\\xa0laws and local laws which include data privacy\\nrequirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, foreign currency-related regulations, anti-competition regulations, prohibitions on payments to governmental officials, market access, import, export and general trade regulations, including but not\\nlimited to economic sanctions and embargos. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business, including the\\nloss of trade privileges. Any such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, could delay or prevent potential acquisitions and could also materially damage our\\n\\n \\xa0 19 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n \\nreputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results. Compliance with these laws requires a significant\\namount of management attention and effort, which may divert management\\x92s attention from running our business operations and could harm our ability to grow our business, or may increase our expenses as we engage specialized or other additional\\nresources to assist us with our compliance efforts. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties. We monitor our operations and investigate allegations of improprieties relating to transactions\\nand the way in which such transactions are recorded. Where circumstances warrant, we provide information and report our findings to government authorities, but no assurance can be given that action will not be taken by such authorities. \\nWe are also subject to a variety of other risks and challenges in managing an organization operating globally, including those related to: \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n general economic conditions in each country or region; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n fluctuations in currency exchange rates and related impacts to customer demand and our operating results;\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n difficulties in transferring funds from or converting currencies in certain countries that could lead to a devaluation\\nof our net assets, in particular our cash assets, in that country\\x92s currency;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n regulatory changes, including government austerity measures in certain countries that we may not be able to\\nsufficiently plan for or avoid that may unexpectedly impair bank deposits or other cash assets that we hold in these countries or that impose additional taxes that we may be required to pay in these countries; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n political unrest, terrorism and the potential for other hostilities; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n common local business behaviors that are in direct conflict with our business ethics, practices and conduct policies;\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n natural disasters;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, wildfires and increased storm sensitivity);\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n overlapping tax regimes;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n public health risks, social risks and supporting infrastructure stability risks, particularly in areas in which we\\nhave significant operations; and  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries. \\nThe variety of risks and challenges listed above could also disrupt or otherwise negatively impact the supply chain operations for our hardware\\nbusiness and the sales of our products and services in affected countries or regions.  As the majority shareholder of Oracle Financial Services\\nSoftware Limited, a publicly traded company in India, and Oracle Corporation Japan, a publicly traded company in Japan, we are faced with several additional risks, including being subject to local securities regulations and being unable to exert\\nfull control that we would otherwise have if these entities were wholly-owned subsidiaries.  Acquisitions present many risks and we may not\\nrealize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of a transaction.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We continue to invest billions of dollars to acquire companies, products, services and technologies. We have a selective\\nand active acquisition program and we expect to continue to make acquisitions in the future because acquisitions are an important element of our overall corporate strategy. Risks we may face in connection with our acquisition program include: \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n our ongoing business may be disrupted and our management\\x92s attention may be diverted by acquisition, transition\\nor integration activities; \\n \\xa0 20 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may have difficulties (1)\\xa0managing an acquired company\\x92s technologies or lines of business;\\n(2)\\xa0entering new markets where we have no or limited direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions; or (3)\\xa0retaining key personnel from the acquired companies; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n an acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected, we may not integrate an acquired company or\\ntechnology as successfully as we expected, we may impose our business practices or alter go-to-market strategies that adversely impact the acquired business or we may\\noverpay for, or otherwise not realize the expected return on, our investments, which could adversely affect our business or operating results and potentially cause impairment to assets that we recorded as a part of an acquisition including\\nintangible assets and goodwill;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n our operating results or financial condition may be adversely impacted by (1)\\xa0claims or liabilities that we\\nassume from an acquired company or technology or that are otherwise related to an acquisition, including, among others, claims from government agencies, terminated employees, current or former customers, former stockholders or other third parties; (2)\\xa0pre-existing contractual relationships of an acquired company that we would not have otherwise entered into, the termination or modification of which may be costly or disruptive to our business;\\n(3)\\xa0unfavorable revenue recognition or other accounting treatment as a result of an acquired company\\x92s practices;

 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may not realize the anticipated increase in our revenues from an acquisition for a number of reasons, including if\\na larger than predicted number of customers decline to renew cloud-based subscription contracts or software or hardware support contracts, if we are unable to sell the acquired products or service offerings to our customer base, if acquired\\ncustomers do not elect to purchase our technologies due to differing business practices or if contract models of an acquired company do not allow us to recognize revenues on a timely basis; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technologies, products, services and their related supply chain\\noperations with our existing lines of business and supply chain infrastructure and maintaining uniform standards, architecture, controls, procedures and policies; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may have multiple product lines or services offerings as a result of our acquisitions that are offered, priced and\\nsupported differently, which could cause customer confusion and delays;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may have higher than anticipated costs in continuing support and development of acquired products or services, in\\ngeneral and administrative functions that support new business models, or in compliance with associated regulations that are more complicated than we had anticipated; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may be unable to obtain timely approvals from, or may otherwise have certain limitations, restrictions, penalties\\nor other sanctions imposed on us by worker councils or similar bodies under applicable employment laws as a result of an acquisition, which could adversely affect our integration plans in certain jurisdictions and potentially increase our\\nintegration and restructuring expenses;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may be unable to obtain required approvals from governmental authorities under competition and antitrust laws on a\\ntimely basis, if at all, which could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, adversely affect our integration plans in certain jurisdictions, restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals\\nof an acquisition, or have other adverse effects on our current business and operations;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n our use of cash to pay for acquisitions may limit other potential uses of our cash, including stock repurchases,\\ndividend payments and retirement of outstanding indebtedness; \\n \\xa0 21 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt\\nto pay for an acquisition and we may have to delay or not proceed with a substantial acquisition if we cannot obtain the necessary funding to complete the acquisition in a timely manner or on favorable terms; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n to the extent that we issue a significant amount of equity securities in connection with future acquisitions, existing\\nstockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease; and  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may experience additional or unexpected changes in how we are required to account for our acquisitions pursuant to\\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles, including arrangements that we assume from an acquisition.  The occurrence of any\\nof these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or several concurrent acquisitions. \\nAny failure to offer high-quality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial\\nresults.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications, platform and infrastructure offerings. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate\\nshort-term increases in customer demand for support services. Increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. Any failure to maintain high-quality\\ntechnical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our applications to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results, and\\nfinancial position.  We may fail to achieve our financial forecasts due to inaccurate sales forecasts or other\\nfactors.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our revenues, particularly certain of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues and hardware revenues, are difficult to forecast. As a result, our quarterly\\noperating results can fluctuate substantially.  For our Oracle Cloud Services, we may use conversion or renewal rates in our forecasts that differ\\nmaterially from our actual conversion or renewal rates because this business is continuing to evolve and such rates may be unpredictable. For our license business, we use a \\x93pipeline\\x94 system, a common industry practice, to forecast sales\\nand trends in that business. Our sales personnel monitor the status of all proposals and estimate when a customer will make a purchase decision and the dollar amount of the sale. These estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales\\npipeline. Our pipeline estimates can prove to be unreliable both in a particular quarter and over a longer period of time, in part because the conversion rate or closure rate of the pipeline into contracts can be very difficult to estimate. \\nA reduction in the conversion rates, renewal rates, or in the pipeline itself, could cause us to plan or budget incorrectly and adversely affect our\\nbusiness or results of operations. In particular, a slowdown in IT spending or economic conditions generally can unexpectedly reduce the conversion rates and renewal rates in particular periods as purchasing decisions are delayed, reduced in amount\\nor cancelled. The conversion rates can also be affected by the tendency of some of our customers to wait until the end of a fiscal period in the hope of obtaining more favorable terms, which can also impede our ability to negotiate, execute and\\ndeliver upon these contracts in a timely manner. In addition, for newly acquired companies, we have limited ability to predict how their pipelines will convert into sales or revenues for a number of quarters following the acquisition. Conversion\\nrates and renewal rates post-acquisition may be quite different from the acquired companies\\x92 historical conversion rates. Differences in conversion rates and renewal rates can also be affected by changes in business practices that we implement\\nin our newly acquired companies. These changes may negatively affect customer behavior.  A substantial portion of our cloud license and on-premise license, and hardware contracts is completed in the latter part of a quarter and a significant percentage of these are larger orders. Because a significant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed\\nin the short term, sales and revenue shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability. The number of large cloud license and on-premise license transactions and, to a lesser\\nextent, hardware products transactions increases the risk of fluctuations in our quarterly results because a delay in even a small number of these transactions could cause our quarterly sales, revenues and profitability to fall significantly short\\nof our predictions. \\n \\xa0 22 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n We may experience foreign currency gains and losses. Changes in currency exchange rates can\\nadversely affect customer demand and our revenue and profitability.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We conduct a significant number of transactions and hold cash in currencies other than the U.S.\\xa0Dollar. Changes in the values of major foreign\\ncurrencies, particularly the Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound, relative to the U.S.\\xa0Dollar can significantly affect our total assets, revenues, operating results and cash flows, which are reported in U.S. Dollars. In particular, the\\neconomic uncertainties relating to European sovereign and other debt obligations may cause the value of the Euro to fluctuate relative to the U.S.\\xa0Dollar. Fluctuations in foreign currency rates, including the strengthening of the\\nU.S.\\xa0Dollar against the Euro and most other major international currencies, adversely affects our revenue growth in terms of the amounts that we report in U.S. Dollars after converting our foreign currency results into U.S. Dollars and in terms\\nof actual demand for our products and services as certain of these products may become relatively more expensive for foreign currency-based enterprises to purchase. In addition, currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our\\nproducts in countries outside of the U.S. Generally, our revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the dollar weakens. In addition, our reported\\nassets generally are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies as a portion of our consolidated cash and bank deposits, among other assets, are held in foreign currencies. \\nIn addition, we incur foreign currency transaction gains and losses, primarily related to sublicense fees and other intercompany agreements among us\\nand our subsidiaries that we expect to cash settle in the near term, which are charged against earnings in the period incurred. We have a program which primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts designed to offset the risks associated\\nwith certain foreign currency exposures. We may suspend the program from time to time. As a part of this program, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset at least\\nin part by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in an effort to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transaction gains or losses. A large portion of our consolidated operations are\\ninternational, and we expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts. For example, we will experience foreign currency gains\\nand losses in certain instances if it is not possible or cost-effective to hedge our foreign currency exposures, if our hedging efforts are ineffective, or should we suspend our foreign currency forward contract program. Our ultimate realized loss\\nor gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency exposures that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, whether we have entered\\ninto foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors.\\xa0All of these factors could materially impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \\nWe have incurred foreign currency losses associated with the devaluation of currencies in certain highly inflationary economies relative to the\\nU.S.\\xa0Dollar. We could incur future losses in emerging market countries where we do business should their currencies become designated as highly inflationary. \\nOur hardware revenues and profitability have declined and could continue to decline.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our hardware business may\\nadversely affect our overall profitability. We may not achieve our estimated revenue, profit or other financial projections with respect to our hardware business in a timely manner or at all due to a number of factors, including: \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n our changes in hardware strategies, offerings and technologies including the development marketing and sale of our own\\nOracle Cloud Services, which could adversely affect demand for our hardware products;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n our hardware business has higher expenses as a percentage of revenues, and thus has been less profitable, than our\\ncloud and license business;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n our focus on our more profitable Oracle Engineered Systems, such as our Oracle Exadata Database Machine, and the de-emphasis of our lower profit margin commodity hardware products, which could adversely affect our hardware revenues because the lower profit products have historically constituted a larger portion of our hardware\\nrevenues; \\n \\xa0 23 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n changes in strategies for the development and introduction of new versions or next generations of our hardware\\nproducts, including the pace at which we offer new versions or next generations of our hardware products, and the related impacts from customers that may defer or delay purchases of existing hardware products and wait for these new releases, all of\\nwhich could adversely affect our hardware revenues;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n a greater risk of material charges that could adversely affect our operating results, such as potential write-downs\\nand impairments of our inventories; higher warranty expenses than what we experience in our cloud and license and services businesses; and amortization and potential impairment of intangible assets associated with our hardware business;\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the close connection between hardware products (which have a finite life) and customer demand for related hardware\\nsupport in which hardware products that approach the end of their useful lives are less likely to have hardware support contracts renewed by customers; and  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may acquire hardware companies that are strategically important to us but (1)\\xa0operate in hardware businesses\\nwith historically lower operating margins than our own; (2)\\xa0have different legacy business practices and go-to-market strategies than our own that we may alter as a\\npart of our integration efforts, which may significantly impact our estimated revenues and profits from the acquired company; (3)\\xa0leverage different platforms or competing technologies that we may encounter difficulties in integrating; or\\n(4)\\xa0utilize unique manufacturing processes that affect our ability to scale these acquired products within our own manufacturing operations. \\nOur hardware offerings are complex products, and if we cannot successfully manage this complexity, the results of our hardware business will\\nsuffer.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Designing, developing, manufacturing and introducing new hardware products are complicated processes. The development process for our hardware products is uncertain and requires a high level of innovation.\\nAfter the development phase, we must be able to forecast customer demand and manufacture new hardware products in sufficient volumes to meet this demand and do so in a cost-effective manner. Our \\x93build-to-order\\x94 manufacturing model, in which our hardware products generally are not built until after customers place orders, may from time to time experience delays in delivering our hardware\\nproducts to customers in a timely manner. These delays could cause our customers to purchase hardware products and services from our competitors. We must also manage new hardware product introductions and transitions to minimize the impact of\\ncustomer delayed purchases of existing hardware products in anticipation of new hardware product releases. It is also possible that we could experience design or manufacturing flaws, which could delay or prevent the production of the components for\\nwhich we have previously committed to pay or need to fulfill orders from customers and could also prevent the production of our hardware products or cause our hardware products to be returned, recalled or rejected resulting in lost revenues,\\nincreases in warranty costs or costs related to remediation efforts, damage to our reputation, penalties and litigation.  We depend on suppliers to\\ndesign, develop, manufacture and deliver on a timely basis the necessary technologies and components for our hardware products, and there are some technologies and components that can only be purchased from a single vendor due to price, quality,\\ntechnology, availability or other business constraints. As a result, our supply chain operations could be disrupted or negatively impacted by industry consolidation and component constraints or shortages, natural disasters, political unrest, port\\nstoppages or other transportation disruptions or slowdowns, or other factors affecting the countries or regions where these single source component vendors are located or where the products are being shipped. We may be unable to purchase these items\\nfrom the respective single vendors on acceptable terms or may experience significant shortages, delays or quality issues in the delivery of necessary technologies, parts or components from a particular vendor. If we had to find a new supplier for\\nthese technologies, parts and components, hardware product shipments could be delayed, which would adversely affect our hardware revenues. We could also experience fluctuations in component prices, which, if unanticipated, could negatively affect\\nour hardware business cost structure. Additionally, we could experience changes in shipping and logistics of our hardware products, which could result in fluctuations in prices and negatively impact our hardware margins. These factors may make it\\ndifficult for us to plan and procure appropriate component inventory levels in a timely fashion to meet customer demand for our hardware products. Therefore, we may experience component inventory \\n \\xa0 24 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n \\nshortages, which may result in production delays or customers choosing to purchase fewer hardware products from us or hardware products from our competitors. We negotiate supply commitments with\\nvendors early in the manufacturing process to ensure we have sufficient technologies and components for our hardware products to meet anticipated customer demand. We must also manage our levels of older component inventories used in our hardware\\nproducts to minimize inventory write-offs or write-downs. If we have excess inventory, it may be necessary to write-down the inventory, which would adversely affect our operating results. If one or more of the risks described above occurs, our\\nhardware business and related operating results could be materially and adversely affected.  We are susceptible to third-party manufacturing\\nand logistics delays, which could result in the loss of sales and customers.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We outsource the design, manufacturing, assembly and delivery of certain of our hardware products to a variety of companies, many of which\\nare located outside the U.S. Our reliance on these third parties reduces our control over the manufacturing and delivery process, exposing us to risks, including reduced control over quality assurance, product costs, product supply and delivery\\ndelays as well as the political and economic uncertainties and natural disasters of the international locations where certain of these third-party manufacturers have facilities and operations. Some countries may raise national security concerns or\\nimpose market access restrictions based on location of manufacturing or sourcing. Any manufacturing disruption or logistics delays by these third parties could impair our ability to fulfill orders for these hardware products for extended periods of\\ntime. If we are unable to manage our relationships with these third parties effectively, or if these third parties experience delays, disruptions, capacity constraints, regulatory issues or quality control problems in their operations, or fail to\\nmeet our future requirements for timely delivery, our ability to ship and deliver certain of our hardware products to our customers could be impaired and our hardware business could be harmed. \\nWe endeavor to continue simplifying our supply chain processes by reducing the number of third-party manufacturing partners and the number of locations\\nwhere these third-party manufacturers build our hardware products. We therefore have become more dependent on a fewer number of these manufacturing partners and locations. If these partners experience production problems or delays or cannot meet our\\ndemand for products, we may not be able to find alternate manufacturing sources in a timely or cost-effective manner, if at all. If we are required to change third-party manufacturers, our ability to meet our scheduled hardware products deliveries\\nto our customers could be adversely affected, which could cause the loss of sales and existing or potential customers, delayed revenue recognition or an increase in our hardware products expenses, all of which could adversely affect the margins of\\nour hardware business.  These challenges and risks also exist when we acquire companies with hardware products and related supply chain operations.\\nIn some cases, we may be dependent, at least initially, on these acquired companies\\x92 supply chain operations that we are less familiar with and thus we may be slower to adjust or react to these challenges and risks. \\nOur cloud and license, and hardware indirect sales channel could affect our future operating results.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our cloud\\nand license, and hardware indirect channel network is comprised primarily of resellers, system integrators/implementers, consultants, education providers, internet service providers, network integrators and independent software vendors. Our\\nrelationships with these channel participants are important elements of our cloud, software and hardware marketing and sales efforts. Our financial results could be adversely affected if our contracts with channel participants were terminated, if\\nour relationships with channel participants were to deteriorate, if any of our competitors enter into strategic relationships with or acquire a significant channel participant, if the financial condition or operations of our channel participants\\nwere to weaken or if the level of demand for our channel participants\\x92 products and services were to decrease. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining, expanding or developing our relationships with channel\\nparticipants. If we are not successful, we may lose sales opportunities, customers and revenues.  We may not be able to protect our\\nintellectual property rights.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We rely on copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite our\\nefforts, these protections may be limited. Unauthorized third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer portions of our products or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property. Any \\n \\xa0 25 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n \\npatents owned by us may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. Any of our pending or future patent applications, whether or not being currently challenged, may not be issued with the scope\\nof the claims we seek, if at all. In addition, the laws of some countries do not provide the same level of protection of our intellectual property rights as do the laws and courts of the U.S. If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights\\nagainst unauthorized copying or use, or other misappropriation, we may not remain competitive.  Third parties have claimed, and in the future\\nmay claim, infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights and/or breach of license agreement provisions.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We periodically receive notices from, or have lawsuits filed against us by, others claiming infringement\\nor other misuse of their intellectual property rights and/or breach of our agreements with them. These third parties include entities that do not have the capabilities to design, manufacture, or distribute products or services or that acquire\\nintellectual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims of infringement and misuse. We expect to continue to receive such claims as: \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we continue to acquire companies and expand into new businesses; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the use and support of third-party code (including open source code) becomes more prevalent in the industry;\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the volume of issued patents continues to increase; and \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n non-practicing entities continue to assert intellectual property infringement\\nin our industry segments.  Responding to any such claim, regardless of its validity, could: \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n be time consuming, costly and result in litigation; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n divert management\\x92s time and attention from developing our business; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find\\nacceptable;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n require us to stop selling or to redesign certain of our products; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n require us to release source code to third parties, possibly under open source license terms; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n require us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers; or \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\\n Our periodic workforce restructurings and reorganizations can be disruptive.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We have in the\\npast restructured or made other adjustments to our workforce, including our hardware employees and direct sales force, in response to management changes, product changes, performance issues, change in strategies, acquisitions and other internal and\\nexternal considerations. In the past, these types of restructurings have resulted in increased restructuring costs, increased sales and marketing costs and temporary reduced productivity while the employees adjusted to their new roles and\\nresponsibilities. In addition, we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth or cost savings benefits of these restructurings, or may not do so within the expected timeframe. These effects could recur in connection with future acquisitions and\\nother restructurings and our revenues and other results of operations could be negatively affected.  We may lose key employees or may be\\nunable to hire enough qualified employees.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We rely on hiring qualified employees and the continued service of our senior management, including our Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Technology Officer and\\nfounder, our Chief Executive Officers, other members of our executive team and other key employees. In the technology industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business, product development, technical and other\\npersonnel. We may also experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher sales. We may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel. With rare\\nexceptions, we do not have long-term employment or non-competition agreements with our employees. Members of our senior management team have left Oracle over the years for a variety of reasons, and we cannot\\nguarantee that there will not be additional departures, which may be disruptive to our operations. \\n \\xa0 26 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n We continually focus on improving our cost structure by hiring personnel in countries where advanced\\ntechnical expertise and other expertise are available at lower costs. When we make adjustments to our workforce, we may incur expenses associated with workforce reductions that delay the benefit of a more efficient workforce structure. We may also\\nexperience increased competition for employees in these countries as the trend toward globalization continues, which may affect our employee retention efforts and increase our expenses in an effort to offer a competitive compensation program. In\\naddition, changes to immigration and labor law policies may adversely impact our access to technical and professional talent.  Our general\\ncompensation program includes restricted stock units, performance equity and stock options, which are important tools in attracting and retaining employees in our industry. If our stock price performs poorly, it may adversely affect our ability to\\nretain or attract employees. We continually evaluate our compensation practices and consider changes from time to time, such as reducing the number of employees granted equity awards or the number of equity awards granted per employee and granting\\nalternative forms of stock-based compensation, which may have an impact on our ability to retain employees and the amount of stock-based compensation expense that we record. Any changes in our compensation practices or those of our competitors could\\naffect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel.  Our sales to government clients expose us to\\nbusiness volatility and risks, including government budgeting cycles and appropriations, procurement regulations, governmental policy shifts, early termination of contracts, audits, investigations, sanctions and\\npenalties.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We derive revenues from contracts with the U.S. government, state and local governments, and foreign governments and are subject to procurement laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and\\nperformance of those contracts.  Governmental entities are variously pursuing policies that affect our ability to sell our products and services.\\nChanges in government procurement policy, priorities, technology initiatives, and/or contract award criteria may negatively impact our potential for growth in the government sector. \\nWe are also subject to early termination of our contracts. Many governmental entities have the right to terminate contracts at any time, without cause.\\nFor example, the U.S. federal government may terminate any of our government contracts and subcontracts at its convenience, or for default based on our performance. \\nU.S. federal contracts are subject to the congressional approval of appropriations to fund the expenditures under these contracts. Similarly, our\\ncontracts with U.S. state and local governments, foreign governments and their agencies are generally subject to government funding authorizations. Contracts may be terminated based upon a lack of appropriated funds. \\nThere is increased pressure on governments and their agencies, both domestically and internationally, to reduce spending as governments continue to\\nface significant deficit reduction pressures. This may adversely impact spending on government programs.  Government contracts laws and regulations\\nimpose certain risks, and contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations. If violations of law are found, they could result in civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refund of a\\nportion of fees received, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business. \\nWe may not receive significant revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years, if at\\nall.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Developing our cloud and license, and hardware offerings is expensive and the investment in the development of these offerings often involves a long return on investment cycle. An important element of our\\ncorporate strategy is to continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development and related product and service opportunities both through internal investments and the acquisition of intellectual property from companies\\nthat we have acquired. Accelerated product and service introductions and short life cycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by revenue increases. We\\nbelieve that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. However, we do not expect to receive significant revenues from these investments for several\\nyears, if at all. \\n \\xa0 27 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n Business disruptions could adversely affect our operating results.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0A\\nsignificant portion of our critical business operations are concentrated in a few geographic areas, some of which include emerging market international locations that may be less stable relative to running such business operations solely within the\\nU.S. We are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems and processes could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, including some of our cloud offerings, and enabling a seamless customer experience with\\nrespect to our customer facing back office processes. A major earthquake or fire, political, social or other disruption to infrastructure that supports or operations or other catastrophic event or the effects of climate change (such as increased\\nstorm severity, drought and pandemics) that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results\\ncould be materially and adversely affected.  Adverse litigation results could affect our business.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We are\\nsubject to various legal proceedings. Litigation can be lengthy, expensive and disruptive to our operations, and can divert our management\\x92s attention away from running our core business. The results of our litigation also cannot be predicted\\nwith certainty. An adverse decision could result in monetary damages or injunctive relief that could affect our business, operating results or financial condition. Additional information regarding certain of the lawsuits we are involved in is\\ndiscussed under Note\\xa017 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.  We may have exposure to\\nadditional tax liabilities.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in both the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions.\\nSignificant uncertainties exist with respect to the amount of our tax liabilities, including those arising from potential changes in laws in the countries in which we do business and the possibility of adverse determinations with respect to the\\napplication of existing laws. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by tax authorities, which often do not agree with positions taken by us on\\nour tax returns. Any unfavorable resolution of these uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate.  Increasingly, countries\\naround the world are actively considering or have enacted changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations. In particular, the recently enacted U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act) significantly changed\\nhow corporations are taxed in the United States, which has had and we expect will continue to have a meaningful impact on our provision for income taxes. Due to the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, we made reasonable\\nestimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements for the year ended May\\xa031, 2018. The U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and other standards-setting bodies may issue guidance on\\nhow the provisions of the Tax Act will be applied that is different from our interpretation. The Tax Act requires complex computations not previously required or produced, and significant judgments and assumptions in the interpretation of the law\\nwere made in producing our provisional estimates. As we complete our analyses, and interpret any additional guidance, we may adjust the provisional amounts we have recorded, and those adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes\\nin the period in which the adjustments are made. We also anticipate that uncertainty in the application of the Tax Act to our ongoing operations as well as possible adverse future law changes attributable to changes in the U.S. political environment\\ncould have an adverse impact on our future tax rate. Other countries also continue to consider enacting new laws, including changes in withholding tax regimes and the imposition of taxes targeted at certain technology businesses (some of which may\\nbe made in response to the Tax Act), that could adversely affect us.  As a part of our income tax structure, there are many intercompany\\ntransactions and calculations made in the ordinary course of business where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our intercompany transfer pricing has been and is currently being reviewed by the IRS and by foreign tax jurisdictions and will\\nlikely be subject to additional audits in the future. Although we have negotiated a number of agreements with certain taxing jurisdictions, these agreements do not cover substantial elements of our transfer pricing. In recent periods, transfer\\npricing audits in many foreign jurisdictions have become increasingly contentious. Similarly, certain jurisdictions are increasingly raising concerns about certain withholding tax matters under current law. In addition, our provision for income\\ntaxes could be adversely affected by shifts of earnings from jurisdictions or regimes that have relatively lower statutory tax rates to those in which the rates are relatively higher. \\n \\xa0 28 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n We are also subject to non-income based taxes, such as payroll,\\nsales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions that have uncertain applicability to the businesses in which we are engaged. Although we believe that our income\\nand non-income based tax estimates are reasonable, there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax\\nprovisions and accruals.  Charges to earnings resulting from acquisitions may adversely affect our operating\\nresults.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Under business combination accounting standards pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805, Business Combinations, we recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and\\nany non-controlling interests in acquired companies generally at their acquisition date fair values and, in each case, separately from goodwill. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess\\namount of consideration transferred, which is also generally measured at fair value, and the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions\\nbelieved to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain. After we complete an acquisition, the following factors could result in material charges and adversely affect our operating results and may adversely affect our cash flows: \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n costs incurred to combine the operations of companies we acquire, such as transitional employee expenses and employee\\nretention, redeployment or relocation expenses;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n impairment of goodwill or impairment of intangible assets; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n amortization of intangible assets acquired; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n a reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets acquired; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n identification of, or changes to, assumed contingent liabilities, both income tax and\\nnon-income tax related, after our final determination of the amounts for these contingencies or the conclusion of the measurement period (generally up to one year from the acquisition date), whichever comes\\nfirst;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n charges to our operating results to maintain certain duplicative pre-merger\\nactivities for an extended period of time or to maintain these activities for a period of time that is longer than we had anticipated, charges to eliminate certain duplicative pre-merger activities, and\\ncharges to restructure our operations or to reduce our cost structure;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n charges to our operating results due to expenses incurred to effect the acquisition; and \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n charges to our operating results due to the expensing of certain stock awards assumed in an acquisition.\\n Substantially all of these costs will be accounted for as expenses that will adversely impact our operating results for the\\nperiods in which those costs are incurred. Charges to our operating results in any given period could differ substantially from other periods based on the timing and size of our future acquisitions and the extent of integration activities. A more\\ndetailed discussion of our accounting for business combinations and other items is presented in the \\x93Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\x94 section of Management\\x92s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\\nOperations (Item 7) included elsewhere in this Annual Report.  There are risks associated with our outstanding and future\\nindebtedness.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0As of May\\xa031, 2018, we had an aggregate of $60.9\\xa0billion of outstanding indebtedness that will mature between calendar year 2018 and calendar year 2055 and we may incur additional indebtedness\\nin the future. Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations, generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt and the other factors discussed in this\\nsection. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.  We may also need to refinance a portion of our\\noutstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other\\nfactors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. Should we incur future increases in interest expense, our ability to utilize\\ncertain of our foreign tax credits to reduce our U.S. federal income tax could be limited, which could unfavorably affect our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. In addition, changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit\\nrating \\n \\xa0 29 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n \\ncould negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase the interest amounts we pay on certain outstanding or future debt. These risks could adversely affect our\\nfinancial condition and results of operations.  Environmental and other related laws and regulations subject us to a number of risks and\\ncould result in significant liabilities and costs.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Some of our cloud and hardware operations are subject to state, federal and international laws governing protection of the environment, proper handling and disposal of\\nmaterials used for these products, human health and safety, the use of certain chemical substances and the labor practices of suppliers, as well as local testing and labelling requirements. Compliance with these environmental and other laws could\\nincrease our product design, development, procurement, manufacturing, delivery, cloud operations and administration costs, limit our ability to manage excess and obsolete non-compliant inventory, change our\\nsales activities, or otherwise impact future financial results of our cloud and hardware businesses. Any violation of these laws can subject us to significant liability, including fines, penalties and possible prohibition of sales of our products\\nand services into one or more states or countries and result in a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our cloud and hardware businesses. Regulatory, market, and competitive pressures regarding the energy\\nintensity and energy mix for our data center operations may also grow.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted disclosure\\nrequirements for companies that use certain \\x93conflict minerals\\x94 (tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold) in their products. Our supply chain is multi-tiered, global and highly complex. As a provider of hardware end products, we are several steps\\nremoved from the mining and smelting or refining of any conflict minerals in our supply chain. Accordingly, our ability to determine with certainty the origin and chain of custody of conflict minerals is limited. Our relationships with customers and\\nsuppliers could suffer if we are unable to describe our products as \\x93conflict-free.\\x94 We may also face increased costs in complying with conflict minerals disclosure requirements. \\nA significant portion of our hardware revenues come from international sales. Environmental legislation, such as the EU Directive on Restriction of\\nHazardous Substances (RoHS), the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive) and China\\x92s regulation on Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products, may increase our cost of\\ndoing business internationally and impact our hardware revenues from the EU, China and other countries with similar environmental legislation as we endeavor to comply with and implement these requirements. The cumulative impact of international\\nenvironmental legislation could be significant.  Our stock price could become more volatile and your investment could lose\\nvalue.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0All of the factors discussed in this section could affect our stock price. The timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products, product enhancements or technological advances by our\\ncompetitors or us and any announcements by us of acquisitions, major transactions, or management changes could also affect our stock price. Changes in the amounts and frequency of share repurchases or dividends could adversely affect our stock\\nprice. Our stock price could also be affected by factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, among others: speculation in the press and the analyst community, changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts,\\nchanges in investors\\x92 or analysts\\x92 valuation measures for our stock, earnings announcements where our financial results differ from our guidance or investors\\x92 expectations, our credit ratings and market trends unrelated to our\\nperformance. A significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class action lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and divert management\\x92s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our\\nbusiness.  We cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will be fully implemented or that it will enhance long-term stockholder\\nvalue.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In fiscal 2018, our Board of Directors approved expansions of our stock repurchase program totaling $24.0\\xa0billion. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date and we are not obligated to\\nrepurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares. Our repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time and, even if fully implemented, may not enhance long-term stockholder value. \\n \\xa0 30 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n Item 1B.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Unresolved Staff Comments \\nNone.

In June 2018, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share of our outstanding\\ncommon stock payable on July\\xa031, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July\\xa017, 2018. We currently expect to continue paying comparable cash dividends on a quarterly basis; however, future declarations of dividends\\nand the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.  For equity compensation\\nplan information, please refer to Item 12 in Part III of this Annual Report.  Stock Repurchase Program \\nOur Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On December\\xa014, 2017 and February\\xa02, 2018, we\\nannounced that our Board of Directors approved expansions of our stock repurchase program totaling $24.0\\xa0billion. As of May\\xa031, 2018, approximately $17.8\\xa0billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock\\nrepurchase program.  Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on\\nfactors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be\\neffected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time. \\nThe following table summarizes the stock repurchase activity for the three months ended May\\xa031, 2018 and the approximate dollar value of shares\\nthat may yet be purchased pursuant to our stock repurchase program:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n (in millions, except per share amounts)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nTotal\\xa0Number\\xa0ofSharesPurchased\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nAverage\\xa0PricePaid\\xa0perShare\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nTotal\\xa0Number\\xa0ofShares\\xa0Purchased\\xa0\\nasPart\\xa0of\\xa0PubliclyAnnouncedProgram\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nApproximate\\xa0DollarValue\\xa0of\\xa0Shares\\xa0\\nthatMay\\xa0Yet\\xa0BePurchasedUnder\\xa0the\\xa0Program\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n March\\xa01, 2018\\x97March\\xa031, 2018\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n35.5\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n48.68\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n35.5\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n21,120.5\\n\\xa0\\n\\n April\\xa01, 2018\\x97April\\xa030, 2018\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n33.8\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n45.72\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n33.8\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n19,576.4\\n\\xa0\\n\\n May\\xa01, 2018\\x97May\\xa031, 2018\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n37.2\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n46.46\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n37.2\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n17,848.4\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Total\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n106.5\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n46.97\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n106.5\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xa0 32 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n Stock Performance Graph and Cumulative Total Return \\nThe graph below compares the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock with the cumulative total return of the S&P 500 Index and the\\nS&P Information Technology Index for each of the last five fiscal years ended May\\xa031, 2018, assuming an investment of $100 at the beginning of such period and the reinvestment of any dividends.

The results of our acquired companies have been included in our consolidated financial statements since their respective dates of acquisition and have contributed to our revenues, income, earnings per\\nshare and total assets.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nAs of and for the Year Ended May\\xa031,\\n\\xa0\\n\\n (in millions, except per share amounts)\\n\\xa0\\n2018\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2017\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2016\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2015\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2014\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Consolidated Statements of Operations Data:\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Total revenues\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n39,831\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n37,728\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n37,047\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n38,226\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n38,275\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Operating income\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n13,679\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n12,710\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n12,604\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n13,871\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n14,759\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Net income(1)\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n3,825\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n9,335\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n8,901\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n9,938\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n10,955\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Earnings per share\\x97diluted(1)\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n0.90\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n2.21\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n2.07\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n2.21\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n2.38\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n4,238\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n4,217\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n4,305\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n4,503\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n4,604\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Cash dividends declared per common share\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n0.76\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n0.64\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n0.60\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n0.51\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n0.48\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Consolidated Balance Sheets Data:\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Working capital(2)\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n56,769\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n50,337\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n47,105\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n47,314\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n32,954\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Total assets(2)\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0137,264\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0134,991\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0112,180\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0110,903\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa090,266\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Notes payable and other borrowings(3)\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n60,619\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n57,909\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n43,855\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n41,958\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n24,097\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n(1)\\n Our net income and diluted earnings per share were unfavorably\\nimpacted by a net charge of $7.0\\xa0billion during fiscal 2018 due to our preliminary assessment of the one-time effects of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act). The more significant\\nprovisions of the Tax Act as applicable to us are described below under \\x93Impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\\x94.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n(2)\\n Total working capital and total assets sequentially increased in\\nnearly all periods presented primarily due to the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our net income generated during all periods presented and the issuances of long-term senior notes of $10.0\\xa0billion in fiscal 2018,\\n$14.0\\xa0billion in fiscal 2017, $20.0\\xa0billion in fiscal 2015, and €2.0\\xa0billion and $3.0\\xa0billion in fiscal 2014. Our total assets were also favorably impacted by the issuance of $2.5\\xa0billion of short-term borrowings in\\nfiscal 2018, and $3.8\\xa0billion of short-term borrowings in each of fiscal 2017 and 2016. These increases were partially offset by cash used for acquisitions, repurchases of our common stock and dividend payments made in all periods presented,\\nrepayments of certain of our senior notes in fiscal 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015, and the repayment of $3.8\\xa0billion of short-term borrowings in each of fiscal 2018 and 2017. \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n(3)\\xa0\\n Our notes payable and other borrowings, which represented the summation of our notes payable and other borrowings,\\ncurrent, and notes payable and other borrowings, non-current, as reported per our consolidated balance sheets as of the dates listed in the table above, increased between fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2018 primarily\\ndue to the fiscal 2018 issuance of long-term senior notes of $10.0\\xa0billion and short-term borrowings of $2.5\\xa0billion, the fiscal 2017 issuance of long-term senior notes of $14.0\\xa0billion and short-term borrowings of $3.8\\xa0billion,\\nthe fiscal 2016 issuance of $3.8\\xa0billion of short-term borrowings, the issuances of long-term senior notes of $20.0\\xa0billion in fiscal 2015, and €2.0\\xa0billion and $3.0\\xa0billion in fiscal 2014.

This overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported\\nfinancial results. We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition.  Business Overview \\nOracle Corporation provides products and services that address all aspects of corporate information technology (IT) environments\\x97applications,\\nplatform and infrastructure. Our applications, platform and infrastructure offerings are delivered to customers worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models, including cloud-based,\\non-premise, or hybrid, which enable customer choice and flexibility. We market and sell our offerings globally to businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers with a\\nworldwide sales force that is employed by our domestic and international subsidiaries and is positioned to offer the combinations that best meet customer needs. \\nWe have three businesses: cloud and license; hardware; and services; each of which comprises a single operating segment. The descriptions set forth\\nbelow as a part of Management\\x92s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the information contained within Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provide\\nadditional information related to our businesses and operating segments and align as to how our chief operating decision makers (CODMs), which include our Chief Executive Officers and Chief Technology Officer, view our operating results and allocate\\nresources.  Cloud and License Business \\nOur cloud and license line of business, which represented 82%, 80% and 78% of our total revenues in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, markets,\\nsells and delivers a broad spectrum of applications, platform and infrastructure technologies through our cloud and license offerings.  Cloud\\nservices and license support revenues include:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n license support revenues, which is our largest revenues stream. Oracle license support grants rights to unspecified\\nproduct upgrades and maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period, as well as technical support assistance. Substantially all of our customers opt to purchase license support contracts when they purchase Oracle\\napplications, platform and/or infrastructure licenses and substantially all customers renew their license support contracts annually in order to continue to benefit from Oracle\\x92s research and development investments that are utilized as a part\\nof unspecified periodic license updates that may be released and that customers with current license support contracts are entitled to. Our license support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to access\\nthe license, are generally billed in advance of the support services being performed and are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the support services are delivered over the contractual terms; and \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n cloud services revenues, which includes revenues from Oracle Cloud Software-as-a-Service (SaaS),\\nPlatform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and\\nInfrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) offerings (collectively, Oracle Cloud Services), which deliver applications, platform and\\ninfrastructure technologies, respectively, via cloud-based deployment models that we develop functionality for, host, manage and support and that customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period. Our IaaS\\nofferings also include Oracle Managed Cloud Services, which are designed to provide comprehensive software and hardware management, maintenance and security services for customer cloud-based, hybrid IT or other IT infrastructure for a fee for a\\nstated term. The majority of our Oracle Cloud Services arrangements have durations of 12 to 36 months and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period of the contract or, in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud\\nservices are consumed. We strive to renew these cloud services contracts when they are eligible for renewal. \\n \\xa0 35 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n Cloud license and on-premise license revenues include revenues\\nfrom the licensing of our software products including Oracle Applications, Oracle Database, Oracle Fusion Middleware and Java, among others which our customers use for cloud-based, on-premise and other IT\\nenvironments. Our cloud license and on-premise license transactions are generally perpetual in nature and are generally recognized when unrestricted access to the license is granted to the customer provided\\nall other revenue recognition criteria are met. The timing of a few large license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly license revenues, which is different than the typical revenue recognition pattern for our cloud services and\\nlicense support revenues in which revenues are generally recognized ratably over the contractual periods. Cloud license and on-premise license customers have the option to purchase license support contracts,\\nas described above.  Providing choice and flexibility to our customers as to when and how they deploy our applications, platform and infrastructure\\ntechnologies is an important element of our corporate strategy. In recent periods, customer demand has increased for our Oracle Cloud Services. To address customer demand and enable customer choice, we have introduced certain programs for customers\\nto pivot their applications, platform and infrastructure licenses and license support to the Oracle Cloud for new deployments and to migrate to and expand with the Oracle Cloud for their existing workloads. We expect these trends to continue. \\nOur cloud services revenues growth and our cloud license and on-premise license revenues growth are affected by\\nthe strength of general economic and business conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, the strategy for and competitive position of our offerings, our acquisitions, our ability to deliver and renew our cloud services contracts with our\\nexisting customers and foreign currency rate fluctuations. Our license support revenues growth is primarily influenced by three factors: (1)\\xa0the continuity of substantially all of our license support customer contract base renewing their\\nlicense support contracts and substantially all customers continuing to purchase license support contracts in connection with their purchase of a new license; (2)\\xa0the pricing of license support contracts sold in connection with the sale of new\\nlicenses; and (3)\\xa0the pricing of new licenses sold. Customers do so in order to benefit from Oracle\\x92s research and development investments that are utilized as a part of unspecified periodic license updates that may be released and that\\ncustomers with current license support contracts are entitled to.  On a constant currency basis, we expect that our total cloud and license\\nrevenues generally will continue to increase due to:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n expected growth in our cloud services and license support offerings, including the high percentage of customers that\\npurchase and renew their license support contracts;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n continued demand for our cloud license and on-premise license offerings; and\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n contributions from our acquisitions. \\nWe believe all of these factors should contribute to future growth in our cloud and license revenues, which should enable us to continue to make\\ninvestments in research and development to develop and improve our cloud and license products and services.  Our cloud and license business\\x92\\nmargin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues over those\\nquarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this business are generally fixed in the short term.  Hardware Business \\nOur hardware business, which represented 10%, 11% and 13% of our total revenues in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, provides a broad selection\\nof hardware products and hardware-related software products including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, industry-specific hardware, operating systems, virtualization, management and other hardware related software, and related hardware\\nsupport. Hardware transactions are generally recognized as revenues upon delivery to the customer provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Our hardware business also offers related hardware support. We expect to make investments in\\nresearch and development to improve existing hardware products and services and to develop new hardware products and services. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels,\\n\\n \\xa0 36 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n \\nincluding independent distributors and value-added resellers. Our hardware support offerings provide customers with unspecified software updates for software components that are essential to the\\nfunctionality of our hardware products and associated software products such as Oracle Solaris. Our hardware support offerings can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are\\nentered into at the option of the customer, are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees and are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual terms. \\nWe generally expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our cloud and license business due to the\\nincremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services, including direct materials and labor costs. \\nOur quarterly hardware revenues are difficult to predict. Our hardware revenues, cost of hardware and hardware operating margins that we report are\\naffected by, among others: our ability to timely manufacture or deliver a few large hardware transactions; our strategy for and the position of our hardware products relative to competitor offerings; customer demand for competing offerings such as\\nPaaS and IaaS; the strength of general economic and business conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; whether customers decide to purchase hardware support contracts at or in close proximity to the time of hardware product sale; the\\npercentage of our hardware support contract customer base that renews its support contracts and the close association between hardware products, which have a finite life, and customer demand for related hardware support as hardware products age;\\ncustomer decisions to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available; certain of our acquisitions; and foreign currency rate fluctuations. \\nServices Business  Our services business\\nhelps customers and partners maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications, platform and infrastructure technologies. We believe that our services are differentiated based on our focus on Oracle technologies, extensive\\nexperience and broad sets of intellectual property and best practices. Our services offerings include consulting services, advanced support services and education services and represented 8% of our total revenues in fiscal 2018 and 9% of our total\\nrevenues in each of fiscal 2017 and 2016. Our services business has lower margins than our cloud and license and hardware businesses. Our services revenues are impacted by, among others: our strategy for, and the competitive position of, our\\nservices; customer demand for our cloud and license and hardware offerings and the associated services for these offerings; our strategic emphasis on growing our cloud revenues; certain of our acquisitions; general economic conditions; governmental\\nbudgetary constraints; personnel reductions in our customers\\x92 IT departments; and tighter controls over discretionary spending.  Acquisitions\\n Our selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. In recent years, we have invested\\nbillions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies, products, services and technologies, including NetSuite in fiscal 2017.  We\\nexpect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy. Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provides additional information\\nrelated to our recent acquisitions.  We believe that we can fund our future acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and\\nmarketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flow and return\\non invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates \\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the\\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board\\x92s (FASB) Accounting Standards \\n \\xa0 37 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n \\nCodification (ASC), and we consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). GAAP, as set forth within the\\nASC, requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and\\nassumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods\\npresented. To the extent that there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and\\nassumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Revenue Recognition;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Business Combinations;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Goodwill and Intangible Assets\\x97Impairment Assessments; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Accounting for Income Taxes; and \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Legal and Other Contingencies. \\nIn many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management\\x92s judgment in\\nits application. There are also areas in which management\\x92s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. Our senior management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and related\\ndisclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.  Revenue Recognition \\nOur sources of revenues include:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n cloud and license revenues, which include the sale of: cloud services and license support; and cloud license and on-premise licenses, which represent licenses purchased by customers for use in both cloud and on-premise deployments; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n hardware revenues, which include the sale of hardware products including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage,\\nindustry-specific hardware; and hardware support revenues; and  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n services revenues, which are earned from providing cloud-, license- and hardware-related services including\\nconsulting, advanced customer support and education services.  Revenue Recognition for Cloud Services Offerings, Hardware\\nProducts, Hardware Support and Related Services (Non-software Elements)  Our revenue recognition policy\\nfor non-software deliverables including our cloud services offerings, hardware products, hardware support and related services is based upon the accounting guidance contained in ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition, Multiple-Element Arrangements, and we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of cloud services revenues, hardware products\\nrevenues, hardware support and related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period.  Revenues from the sales of our non-software elements are recognized when: (1)\\xa0persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2)\\xa0we deliver the products or services; (3)\\xa0the sale price is fixed or determinable; and\\n(4)\\xa0collection is reasonably assured. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met. \\nRevenues for our cloud services offerings sold on a subscription basis are generally recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date\\nthe service is made available to customers. Revenues for cloud services offerings sold on a usage basis are generally recognized as the customer consumes the service, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. \\n \\xa0 38 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n Revenues from the sale of hardware products are generally recognized upon delivery of the hardware\\nproduct to the customer provided all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. Hardware support contracts are entered into at the customer\\x92s option and are recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangements, which is\\ntypically one year, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied.  Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element\\nArrangements\\x97Cloud Services Offerings, Hardware Products, Hardware Support and Related Services (Non-software Arrangements) \\nWe enter into arrangements with customers that purchase non-software related products and services from us at\\nthe same time, or within close proximity of one another (referred to as non-software multiple-element arrangements). Each element within a non-software multiple-element\\narrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting provided the following criteria are met: the delivered products or services have value to the customer on a standalone basis; and for an arrangement that includes a general right of\\nreturn relative to the delivered products or services, delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service is considered probable and is substantially controlled by us. We consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product or\\nservice is sold separately by us or another vendor or could be resold by the customer. Further, our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products. Where the aforementioned criteria for a\\nseparate unit of accounting are not met, the deliverable is combined with the undelivered element(s) and treated as a single unit of accounting for the purposes of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition. For those units\\nof accounting that include more than one deliverable but are treated as a single unit of accounting, we generally recognize revenues over the contractual period of the arrangement, or in the case of our cloud services offerings, we generally\\nrecognize revenues over the contractual term of the cloud services subscription. For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we allocate revenue to the respective revenue line\\nitems within our consolidated statements of operations based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of relative selling prices of such elements. \\nFor our non-software multiple-element arrangements, we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling\\nprice hierarchy at the arrangement\\x92s inception. The selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy: vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) if available, third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available,\\nor estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE are available (a description as to how we determine VSOE, TPE and ESP is provided below). If a tangible hardware product includes software, we determine whether the tangible hardware product\\nand the software work together to deliver the product\\x92s essential functionality and, if so, the entire product is treated as a non-software deliverable. The total arrangement consideration is allocated to\\neach separate unit of accounting for each of the non-software deliverables using the relative selling prices of each unit based on the selling price hierarchy. We limit the amount of revenue recognized for\\ndelivered elements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional products or services or meeting of any specified performance conditions. \\nWhen possible, we establish VSOE of selling price for deliverables in software and non-software\\nmultiple-element arrangements using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately. TPE is established by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated customers.\\nIf we are unable to determine the selling price because VSOE or TPE does not exist, we determine ESP for the purposes of allocating the arrangement by reviewing historical transactions, including transactions whereby the deliverable was sold on a\\nstandalone basis and considering several other external and internal factors.  Revenue Recognition for Cloud License and On-Premise License and License Related Services (Software Elements)  The basis for our cloud license and on-premise license revenues and related services revenue recognition is substantially governed by the accounting guidance contained in ASC 985-605, Software-Revenue\\nRecognition. We exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of cloud license and on-premise license revenues and related services revenues to be recognized in\\neach accounting period. \\n \\xa0 39 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n For license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying\\nlicense, we recognize cloud license and on-premise license revenues when: (1)\\xa0we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software; (2)\\xa0we deliver the products;\\n(3)\\xa0the sale price is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties; and (4)\\xa0collection is probable. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of license sale because the foregoing conditions are not met,\\nare generally recognized when those conditions are subsequently met.  The vast majority of our cloud license and\\non-premise license arrangements include license support contracts, which are entered into at the customer\\x92s option. We recognize the related fees ratably over the term of the arrangement, typically one\\nyear. License support contracts provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period and include internet access to technical content, as well as\\ninternet and telephone access to technical support personnel. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net cloud license and on-premise license fees and are generally invoiced in\\nfull at the beginning of the support term. Substantially all of our customers renew their license support contracts annually.  Revenue\\nRecognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements\\x97Cloud License and On-Premise License, Support and Related Services (Software Arrangements) \\nWe often enter into arrangements with customers that purchase cloud licenses and on-premise licenses, license\\nsupport and related services from us at the same time, or within close proximity of one another (referred to as software related multiple-element arrangements). For those software related multiple-element arrangements, we have applied the residual\\nmethod to determine the amount of cloud license and on-premise license revenues to be recognized pursuant to ASC 985-605. Under the residual method, if VSOE exists for\\nundelivered elements in a multiple-element arrangement, VSOE of the undelivered elements is deferred with the remaining portion of the arrangement consideration generally recognized upon delivery of the license. Where VSOE does not exist for the\\nundelivered element in such arrangement, no revenue is recognized until the earlier of the point in time at which 1) VSOE has been established for such element; or 2) the element that does not have VSOE has been delivered. \\nRevenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements\\x97Arrangements with Software and Non-software\\nElements  We also enter into multiple-element arrangements that may include a combination of our various software related and non-software related products and services offerings including cloud licenses and on-premise licenses, license support, cloud services offerings, hardware products, hardware\\nsupport, consulting, advanced customer support services and education. In such arrangements, we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative selling prices of the software group of elements as a whole and the non-software group of elements. We then further allocate consideration within the software group to the respective elements within that group following the guidance in ASC\\n985-605 and our policies as described above. In addition, we allocate the consideration within the non-software group to each respective element within that group based\\non a selling price hierarchy at the arrangement\\x92s inception as described above. After the arrangement consideration has been allocated to the software group of elements and non-software group of elements,\\nwe account for each respective element in the arrangement as described above and below.  Other Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to\\nSoftware and Non-software Elements  Many of our cloud license and\\non-premise license arrangements include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts and are included as a part of our services business. Consulting revenues from\\nthese arrangements are generally accounted for separately from cloud license and on-premise license revenues because the arrangements qualify as services transactions as defined in ASC 985-605. The more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenues should be accounted for separately include the nature of services (i.e., consideration of whether the services are essential to\\nthe functionality of the licensed product), degree of risk, availability of services from other vendors, timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the license fee. Revenues for consulting services are\\ngenerally recognized as the services are performed. \\n \\xa0 40 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n If an arrangement contains multiple elements and does not qualify for separate accounting for the product\\nand service transactions, then cloud license and on-premise license revenues and/or hardware products revenues, including the costs of hardware products, are generally recognized together with the services\\nbased on contract accounting using either the percentage-of-completion or completed-contract method. \\nWe also evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing \\x93fiscal funding\\x94 or \\x93termination for convenience\\x94 provisions,\\nwhen such provisions are required by law, to determine the probability of possible cancellation. We consider multiple factors, including the history with the customer in similar transactions, the \\x93essential use\\x94 of the license or hardware\\nproducts and the planning, budgeting and approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity. If we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is remote, we then recognize revenues for such arrangements\\nonce all of the criteria described above have been met. If such a determination cannot be made, revenues are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity for such\\narrangements.  We assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenues if all other revenue recognition\\nrequirements are met. Our standard payment terms are net 30 days. However, payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed. We evaluate non-standard payment terms based on\\nwhether we have successful collection history on comparable arrangements (based upon similarity of customers, products, and arrangement economics) and, if so, generally conclude such payment terms are fixed and determinable and thereby satisfy the\\nrequired criteria for revenue recognition.  While most of our arrangements for sales within our businesses include short-term payment terms, we\\nhave a standard practice of providing long-term financing to creditworthy customers primarily through our financing division. Since fiscal 1989, when our financing division was formed, we have established a history of collection, without\\nconcessions, on these receivables with payment terms that generally extend up to five years from the contract date. Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, we recognize cloud license and\\non-premise license revenues and hardware products revenues for these arrangements upon delivery, net of any payment discounts from financing transactions. We have generally sold receivables financed through\\nour financing division on a non-recourse basis to third-party financing institutions within 90 days of the contracts\\x92 dates of execution and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from\\noperating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We account for the sales of these receivables as \\x93true sales\\x94 as defined in ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing, as we are considered to have surrendered control of\\nthese financing receivables.  Our customers include several of our suppliers and, occasionally, we have purchased goods or services for our\\noperations from these vendors at or about the same time that we have sold our products to these same companies (Concurrent Transactions). Cloud license and on-premise license agreements, sales of hardware or\\nsales of services that occur within a common period from the date we have purchased goods or services from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure. When we acquire goods or services from a customer, we\\nnegotiate the purchase separately from any sales transaction, at terms we consider to be at arm\\x92s length and settle the purchase in cash. We recognize revenues from Concurrent Transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are met and\\nthe goods and services acquired are necessary for our current operations.  Business Combinations \\nWe apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, in accounting for our acquisitions. It requires us to recognize separately from\\ngoodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets\\nacquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are\\ninherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to\\n\\n \\xa0 41 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n \\ngoodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are\\nrecorded to our consolidated statements of operations.  Accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates\\nand assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, including our estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, pre-acquisition contingencies and any contingent consideration, where\\napplicable. Although we believe that the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies\\nand are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. \\nWe estimate the fair values of our cloud services and license support, and hardware obligations assumed as part of an acquisition. The estimated fair\\nvalues of these performance obligations are determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs\\nrelated to fulfilling these assumed obligations plus a normal profit margin. The estimated costs to fulfill the assumed obligations are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services including the correction of any errors in\\nthe products acquired. The sum of these costs and operating profit approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the performance obligations. We do not include any costs associated with selling efforts\\nor research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs. Profit associated with any selling efforts is excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded those selling efforts on the performance obligations prior to\\nthe acquisition date. We also do not include the estimated research and development costs in our fair value determinations, as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition. As a result of our fair value\\nestimates for these obligations, we did not recognize certain cloud services and license support revenue amounts and hardware revenue amounts that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities upon delivery of\\nthe contractual obligations (refer to \\x93Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges\\x94 below for further discussion). To the extent customers to which these contractual obligations pertain renew these contracts with us, we expect to\\nrecognize revenues for the full contracts\\x92 values over the respective contracts\\x92 renewal periods.  In connection with a business\\ncombination or other strategic initiative, we may estimate costs associated with restructuring plans committed to by our management. Restructuring costs are typically comprised of employee severance costs, costs of consolidating duplicate facilities\\nand contract termination costs. Restructuring expenses are based upon plans that have been committed to by our management, but may be refined in subsequent periods. We account for costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired\\ncompany separately from the business combination pursuant to ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations. A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated\\nstatement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred. When estimating the fair value of facility restructuring activities, assumptions are applied regarding estimated sub-lease payments to\\nbe received, which can differ materially from actual results. This may require us to revise our initial estimates which may materially affect our results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made. \\nFor a given acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and\\nmay extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a\\npart of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts.  If we cannot\\nreasonably determine the fair value of a pre-acquisition contingency (non-income tax related) by the end of the measurement period, which is generally the case given the\\nnature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (1)\\xa0it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date\\nand (2)\\xa0the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent to the measurement period, changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations\\nand financial position. \\n \\xa0 42 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a\\nbusiness combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded\\nto goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance\\x92s or contingency\\x92s estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax\\npositions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. \\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\\x97Impairment Assessments \\nWe review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in\\naccordance with ASC 350, Intangibles\\x97Goodwill and Other. According to ASC 350, we can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting unit\\x92s goodwill for impairment or we can directly perform the quantitative impairment\\ntest. Should the qualitative assessment be used for any given fiscal year, qualitative factors to consider include cost factors; financial performance; legal, regulatory, contractual, political, business, or other factors; entity specific factors;\\nindustry and market considerations, macroeconomic conditions, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying\\nvalue, a quantitative test is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. For those reporting units tested using a quantitative approach, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit,\\nincluding goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, goodwill impairment is recognized for the difference, limited to the amount of goodwill recognized for the reporting unit.\\n Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include\\nrevenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions and the determination of appropriate market comparables. We base our fair value estimates\\non assumptions which we believe to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to\\ndetermine the carrying values for each of our reporting units.  Our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis, which was performed on\\nMarch\\xa01, 2018, did not result in a goodwill impairment charge, nor did we recognize an impairment charge in fiscal 2017 or 2016.  We make\\njudgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible\\nassets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. Recoverability of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future\\nundiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. \\nAssumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a\\nvariety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Although we believe that the historical assumptions and estimates we have\\nmade are reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results. We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2018, 2017 or 2016. \\nAccounting for Income Taxes \\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many\\ntransactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements \\n \\xa0 43 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n \\namong related entities, the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment and segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to\\navoid double taxation. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a\\nmaterial effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made.  On December\\xa022, 2017 the U.S.\\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act), was signed into law. The net expense related to the enactment of the Tax Act has been accounted for during fiscal 2018 based on provisional estimates pursuant to the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin\\nNo.\\xa0118. Subsequent adjustments, if any, will be accounted for in the period such adjustments are identified. The provisional estimates incorporate, among other factors, assumptions made based on interpretations of the Tax Act and existing tax\\nlaws and a range of historical and forecasted financial and tax-specific facts and information, including, without limitation, the amount of cash and other specified assets anticipated to be held by the\\ncompany\\x92s foreign subsidiaries on relevant dates and estimates of deferred tax balances during interim periods pending finalization of those balances. \\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In order for us to realize\\nour deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We consider future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the\\njurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were\\nto determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a\\ndetermination, or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period. If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would\\nbe realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to earnings at such time.  We\\nrecord deferred tax assets for stock-based compensation awards that result in deductions on certain of our income tax returns based on the amount of stock-based compensation recognized and the fair values attributable to the vested portion of stock\\nawards assumed in connection with a business combination at the statutory tax rates in the jurisdictions that we are able to recognize such tax deductions. The impacts of the actual tax deductions for stock-based awards that are realized in these\\njurisdictions are generally recognized to our consolidated statements of operations in the period that a restricted stock-based award vests or a stock option is exercised with any shortfall/windfall relative to the deferred tax asset established\\nrecorded as a discrete detriment/benefit to our provision for income taxes in this period. Such detriment/benefit can materially impact our reported effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 and prospective periods. \\nWe calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income\\ntax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known, which can materially impact our effective tax rate. \\nThe amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments.\\nOur estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. A description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under \\x93Business\\nCombinations\\x94 above. For those tax related contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we account for these uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740, Income Taxes, which contains a\\ntwo-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is\\nmore likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be\\nrealized upon ultimate settlement. Although we believe that \\n \\xa0 44 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n \\nwe have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due\\nto changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, judicial rulings, and refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is\\ndifferent than the amounts recorded, such differences generally will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made. Our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to\\nreserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties.  In addition, as a part of our accounting for\\nbusiness combinations, intangible assets are recognized at fair values and goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net estimated fair values of assets acquired. Impairment charges associated with goodwill are\\ngenerally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period that any impairment is recorded. Amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible pursuant to our\\nexisting tax structure; however, deferred taxes have been recorded for non-deductible amortization expenses as a part of the accounting for business combinations. We have taken into account the allocation of\\nthese identified intangibles among different taxing jurisdictions, including those with nominal or zero percent tax rates, in establishing the related deferred tax liabilities. \\nLegal and Other Contingencies  We\\nare currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. A description of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as\\na part of a business combination is provided under \\x93Business Combinations\\x94 above. For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any\\nclaim or legal proceeding is considered probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably\\nestimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time the accruals are made. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to\\nour pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. \\nResults of Operations  Impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts\\nand Jobs Act of 2017  The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2018 compared to the corresponding prior year periods, and of\\nour consolidated balance sheets as of May\\xa031, 2018 relative to May\\xa031, 2017, was impacted by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act), which was signed into law on December\\xa022, 2017. Effective January\\xa01, 2018, the Tax\\nAct reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%; creates a quasi-territorial tax system that a) generally allows, among other provisions, companies to repatriate certain foreign source earnings without incurring additional U.S.\\nincome tax for such earnings generated after December\\xa031, 2017 and b) generally requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain foreign subsidiary earnings generated prior to\\nDecember\\xa031, 2017 that, in substantial part, were previously tax deferred; creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings; limits deductibility of certain future compensation arrangements to certain highly compensated employees; and\\nprovides tax incentives for the exportation of U.S. products to foreign jurisdictions and for the purchase of qualifying capital equipment, among other provisions. \\nBecause we have a May\\xa031 fiscal year end, our fiscal 2018 blended U.S. federal statutory tax rate was approximately 29%. \\n \\xa0 45 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n During fiscal 2018, our provision for income taxes increased and our net income decreased, primarily as a\\nresult of the following items related to the enactment of the Tax Act:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n $7.8\\xa0billion of income tax expense, which we refined by a $166\\xa0million increase as of May\\xa031, 2018 from\\nour initial estimate made in our third quarter of fiscal 2018 in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.\\xa0118 (SAB 118), related to the application of the one-time transition tax to certain\\nforeign subsidiary earnings that were generated prior to December\\xa031, 2017 and for which such expense was substantially recorded to non-current income taxes payable in our consolidated balance sheet and\\ncorresponds to the amount we currently expect to periodically settle over an eight year period as provided by the Tax Act; \\npartially offset by:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n $820\\xa0million of income tax benefit, which we refined by a $76\\xa0million increase as of May\\xa031, 2018 from\\nour initial estimate made in our third quarter of fiscal 2018 in accordance with SAB 118, related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future; and\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the net favorable impacts of the Tax Act on our tax profile and effective tax rate beginning on January\\xa01, 2018,\\nwhich we generally expect will continue into future periods.  The net expense related to the enactment of the Tax Act has been\\naccounted for during fiscal 2018 based on provisional estimates pursuant to SAB 118. Subsequent adjustments, if any, will be accounted for in the period such adjustments are identified. The provisional estimates incorporate, among other factors,\\nassumptions made based on interpretations of the Tax Act and existing tax laws and a range of historical financial and tax-specific facts and information, including among other items, the amount of cash and\\nother specified assets and liabilities of the company and its foreign subsidiaries on relevant dates and estimates of deferred tax balances pending finalization of those balances. \\nWe expect the enactment of the Tax Act to generally provide greater flexibility for us to access and utilize our cash, cash equivalent and marketable\\nsecurities balances held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries as of January\\xa01, 2018, as well as for prospective assets generated by these foreign subsidiaries\\x92 future earnings and profits. We believe we have sufficient cash, cash\\nequivalent and marketable securities balances, as well as access to other capital resources, if required, to settle the $7.8\\xa0billion one-time transition tax described above. \\nImpacts of Acquisitions  The\\ncomparability of our operating results in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 and in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was impacted by our recent acquisitions, including our acquisition of NetSuite during the second quarter of fiscal 2017. In our\\ndiscussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, we may qualitatively disclose the impact of our acquired products and services (for the one-year period subsequent to the acquisition date) to the growth in certain of our businesses\\x92 revenues where such qualitative discussions would be meaningful for an understanding of the factors that\\ninfluenced the changes in our results of operations. When material, we may also provide quantitative disclosures related to such acquired products and services. Expense contributions from our recent acquisitions for each of the respective period\\ncomparisons may not be separately identifiable due to the integration of these businesses into our existing operations, and/or were insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented. \\nWe caution readers that, while pre- and post-acquisition comparisons, as well as any quantified amounts\\nthemselves, may provide indications of general trends, any acquisition information that we provide has inherent limitations for the following reasons:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n any qualitative and quantitative disclosures cannot specifically address or quantify the substantial effects\\nattributable to changes in business strategies, including our sales force integration efforts. We believe that if our acquired companies had operated independently and sales forces had not been integrated, the relative mix of products and services\\nsold would have been different; and \\n \\xa0 46 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the amounts shown as cloud services and license support deferred revenues and hardware deferred revenues in our\\n\\x93Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges\\x94 (presented below) are not necessarily indicative of revenue improvements we will achieve upon contract renewals to the extent customers do not renew. \\nPresentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information \\nIn our results of operations discussion below, we provide an overview of our total consolidated revenues, total consolidated expenses and total\\nconsolidated operating margin, all of which are presented on a GAAP basis. We also present a GAAP-based discussion below for substantially all of the other expense items as presented in our consolidated statement of operations that are not directly\\nattributable to our three businesses.  In addition, we discuss below the results of each our three businesses\\x97cloud and license, hardware and\\nservices\\x97which are our operating segments as defined pursuant to ASC 280, Segment Reporting. The financial reporting for our three businesses that is presented below is presented in a manner that is consistent with that used by our\\nCODMs.\\xa0Our operating segment presentation below reflects revenues, direct costs and sales and marketing expenses that correspond to and are directly attributable to each of our three businesses. We also utilize these inputs to calculate and\\npresent a segment margin for each business in the discussion below.  Consistent with our internal management reporting processes, the below\\noperating segment presentation includes revenues adjustments related to cloud services and license support contracts and hardware contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities but were not\\nrecognized in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented due to business combination accounting requirements. Refer to \\x93Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges\\x94 below for additional discussion of these\\nitems and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a reconciliation of the summations of our total operating segment revenues as presented in the discussion below to total revenues as\\npresented per our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented.  In addition, research and development expenses, general and\\nadministrative expenses, stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets, certain other expense allocations, acquisition related and other expenses, restructuring expenses, interest expense,\\nnon-operating income, net and provision for income taxes are not attributed to our three operating segments because our management does not view the performance of our three businesses including such items\\nand/or it is impractical to do so. Refer to \\x93Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges\\x94 below for additional discussion of certain of these items and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this\\nAnnual Report for a reconciliation of the summations of total segment margin as presented in the discussion below to total income before provision of income taxes as presented per our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented.\\n Constant Currency Presentation \\nOur international operations have provided and are expected to continue to provide a significant portion of each of our businesses\\x92 revenues and\\nexpenses. As a result, each businesses\\x92 revenues and expenses and our total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S.\\xa0Dollar against major international currencies. In order to provide a framework for\\nassessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Annual Report using constant currency disclosure.\\nTo present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e., the rates in effect on May\\xa031, 2017, which\\nwas the last day of our prior fiscal year) rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. For example, if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0\\xa0million Euros from products sold on May\\xa031, 2018 and\\n2017, our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of $1.16\\xa0million in fiscal 2018 (using 1.16 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period) and $1.11\\xa0million in fiscal 2017\\n(using 1.11 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period). The constant currency presentation, \\n \\xa0 47 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n \\nhowever, would translate the fiscal 2018 results using the fiscal 2017 exchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during the period. In each of the tables below, we\\npresent the percent change based on actual, unrounded results in reported currency and in constant currency.

2017:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our total revenues\\nincreased in fiscal 2018 primarily due to growth in our cloud and license revenues, partially offset by decreases in our hardware revenues and services revenues. The constant currency increase in our cloud and license revenues during fiscal 2018 was\\nattributable to growth in our cloud services and license support revenues as customers purchased our applications, platform and infrastructure technologies via cloud and license deployment models and renewed their related contracts to continue to\\ngain access to our latest technology and support services. To a lesser extent, our cloud and license revenues also increased due to revenue contributions from our recent acquisitions. The constant currency decrease in our hardware revenues during\\nfiscal 2018 was due to the reduction in our hardware products revenues and hardware support revenues primarily due to the emphasis we placed on the marketing and sale of our cloud and license technologies. The constant currency decrease in our\\nservices revenues during fiscal 2018 was attributable to declines in our education and advanced customer support services revenues. In constant currency, the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions contributed 78%, 10% and 12%, respectively, to the\\ngrowth in our fiscal 2018 total revenues.  Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our total operating expenses increased during\\nfiscal 2018 primarily due to higher cloud services and license support expenses resulting primarily from increased headcount and infrastructure expenses to support the increases in our revenues; higher sales and marketing expenses related to our\\ncloud and license business; increased stock-based compensation expenses; higher general and administrative expenses; increased restructuring expenses; and higher intangible asset amortization. These constant currency expense increases were partially\\noffset by certain expense decreases in fiscal 2018, which primarily consisted of lower research and development expenses primarily related to lower \\n \\xa0 48 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n \\nemployee expenses; and lower hardware products costs and a related decrease in hardware sales and marketing costs, both of which aligned to lower hardware revenues. \\nIn constant currency, our total operating margin increased during fiscal 2018 primarily due to the increase in revenues and total operating margin as a\\npercentage of total revenues remained flat.  Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Excluding the effects of\\nforeign currency rate variations, our total revenues increased in fiscal 2017 due to growth in our cloud and license revenues and our services revenues, partially offset by a decrease in our hardware revenues. The constant currency increases in our\\ncloud and license revenues during fiscal 2017 and constant currency decreases in our hardware revenues during fiscal 2017 were primarily attributable to similar reasons as noted above for the fiscal 2018 changes of each. The constant currency\\nservices revenues increase during fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to certain acquisitions. In constant currency, the Americas region contributed 54%, the EMEA region contributed 24% and the Asia Pacific region contributed 22% to the growth in\\nour total revenues during fiscal 2017.  Excluding the effects of foreign currency rate variations, our total operating expenses increased during\\nfiscal 2017 relative to the prior year period due to higher sales and marketing and research and development expenses, which were primarily attributable to increased headcount and increased stock-based compensation expenses; and higher cloud\\nservices and license support expenses resulting primarily from increased headcount and infrastructure expenses to support the increase in our revenues. These constant currency expense increases were partially offset by certain expense decreases in\\nfiscal 2017, primarily lower hardware expenses due to similar reasons noted for the fiscal 2018 decrease above and lower intangible asset amortization in fiscal 2017 due to certain of our intangible assets that became fully amortized. \\nIn constant currency, our total operating margin increased in fiscal 2017 due to the increase in our total revenues while total operating margin as a\\npercentage of revenues was flat.

The income\\ntax effects presented for fiscal 2017 and 2016 were calculated reflecting effective tax rates of 22.8% and 23.2%, respectively, which represented our effective tax rates as derived per our consolidated statements of operations, primarily due to the\\nnet tax effects of acquisition related items, including the tax effects of amortization of intangible assets, and the net tax effects of stock-based compensation. \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n(8)\\n The income tax reform adjustments for fiscal 2018 presented in the\\ntable above were due to the our enactment of the Tax Act (refer to \\x93Impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\\x94 above for additional discussion), which increased our GAAP provision for income taxes during fiscal 2018.\\n Cloud and License Business  Our\\ncloud and license business engages in the sale, marketing and delivery of our applications, platform and infrastructure technologies through various deployment models including license support offerings; Oracle\\n\\n \\xa0 50 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n \\nCloud Services offerings; and cloud license and on-premise license offerings.

Our Oracle Cloud\\nServices offerings deliver certain of our applications, platform and infrastructure technologies on a subscription basis via cloud-based deployment models that we host, manage and support, and revenues are generally recognized over the subscription\\nperiod. Cloud license and on-premise license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses, generally on a perpetual basis, to use our database and middleware and our applications software\\nproducts within cloud and on-premise IT environments and are generally recognized as revenues when unrestricted access to the license is granted, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met. We\\ncontinue to place significant emphasis, both domestically and internationally, on direct sales through our own sales force. We also continue to market our offerings through indirect channels. Costs associated with our cloud and license business are\\nincluded in cloud services and license support expenses, and sales and marketing expenses. These costs are largely personnel and infrastructure related including the cost of providing our cloud services and license support offerings, salaries and\\ncommissions earned by our sales force for the sale of our cloud and license offerings, and marketing program costs.

Fiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal\\n2017:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, total revenues from our cloud and license business increased in fiscal 2018 due to growth in our cloud services and license support revenues and revenue\\ncontributions from our recent acquisitions. The increases in our constant currency cloud \\n \\xa0 51 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n \\nservices and license support revenues during fiscal 2018 were primarily due to the purchase and renewal of our cloud-based services and license support services, and due to contributions from our\\nrecent acquisitions. These revenues increases were partially offset by decreases in our cloud license and on-premise license revenues during fiscal 2018. In constant currency, our total applications revenues\\nand total platform and infrastructure revenues grew during fiscal 2018 as customers continued to deploy our applications, platform and infrastructure technologies through a wide array of different deployment models that we offer that enable customer\\nchoice. In constant currency, the Americas region contributed 71%, the EMEA region contributed 15% and Asia Pacific region contributed 14% of the constant currency revenues growth for this business during fiscal 2018. \\nIn constant currency, total cloud and license expenses increased in fiscal 2018 primarily due to higher cloud services and license support expenses and\\nhigher sales and marketing expenses, both of which increased primarily due to higher employee related expenses from higher headcount. In addition, our constant currency cloud services and license support expenses increased during fiscal 2018 due to\\nhigher technology infrastructure expenses that supported the growth in our revenues.  Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our\\ncloud and license segment\\x92s total margin increased during fiscal 2018 primarily due to the increase in revenues for this segment while total margin as a percentage of revenues decreased slightly due to expenses growth for this segment. \\nFiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, total revenues, total\\nexpenses and total margin from our cloud and license business each increased in fiscal 2017 relative to fiscal 2016 due to similar reasons as noted above for the increases in fiscal 2018 relative to fiscal 2017. During fiscal 2017, the Americas,\\nEMEA and Asia Pacific regions contributed 63%, 20% and 17%, respectively, of the constant currency revenues growth for this business.  Excluding\\nthe effects of currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and license business\\x92 total margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2017 as our total expenses grew at a faster rate than our total revenues for this business. \\n \\xa0 52 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n Hardware Business \\nOur hardware business\\x92 revenues are generated from the sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems, server, storage, and industry-specific hardware\\nproducts that are generally recognized as revenues upon delivery to the customer, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Our hardware business also earns revenues from the sale of hardware support contracts purchased by our\\ncustomers at their option and are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual term. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels such as independent\\ndistributors and value-added resellers and we also market and sell our hardware products through our direct sales force. Operating expenses associated with our hardware business include the cost of hardware products, which consists of expenses for\\nmaterials and labor used to produce these products by our internal manufacturing operations or by third-party manufacturers, warranty expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the impact of inventory determined to\\nbe excess and obsolete; the cost of materials used to repair customer products; the cost of labor and infrastructure to provide support services; and sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel

Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, total\\nhardware revenues decreased in fiscal 2018 and 2017, each relative to the corresponding prior year period, due to lower hardware products revenues and, to a lesser extent, lower hardware support revenues. The decreases in hardware products revenues\\nin both fiscal 2018 and 2017, each relative to the corresponding prior year period, were primarily attributable to our continued emphasis on the marketing and sale of our cloud-based infrastructure technologies, which resulted in reduced sales\\nvolumes of certain of our hardware product lines and also impacted the volume of customers that purchased hardware support contracts.  Excluding\\nthe effects of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware expenses decreased in fiscal 2018 and 2017, each relative to the corresponding prior year period, primarily due to lower hardware products costs and lower employee related expenses, which\\naligned to lower hardware revenues. \\n \\xa0 53 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n In constant currency, total margin and total margin as percentage of revenues for our hardware segment\\nincreased during fiscal 2018 and 2017, each relative to the corresponding prior year period, due to expense decreases in each of these periods.

In\\naddition, we incurred higher other income, net during fiscal 2017 related to investment gains for our deferred compensation plan investments that we held and classified as trading in comparison to net losses for such investments during fiscal 2016.\\nThe aforementioned favorable movements in non-operating income, net during fiscal 2017 were partially offset by higher foreign currency losses, net during fiscal 2017. \\nProvision for Income Taxes:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our effective tax rates for each of the periods presented were the result of the mix\\nof income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates. In fiscal 2018, the Tax Act was signed into law. The more significant provisions of the Tax Act as applicable to us are described above under \\x93Impacts\\nof the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\\x94. Our provision for income taxes for the fiscal 2018 presented varied from the 21% U.S. statutory rate imposed by the Tax Act due primarily to the January\\xa01, 2018 effective date of the Tax Act, the\\nimpacts of the Tax Act upon adoption, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with tax authorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation, and the U.S. domestic production activity deduction. Prior to the\\nJanuary\\xa01, 2018 effective date of the Tax Act, our provision for income taxes historically differed from the tax computed at the previous U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to certain earnings considered as indefinitely\\nreinvested in foreign operations, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with tax authorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation and the U.S. domestic production activity deduction. Future effective tax\\nrates could be adversely affected by an unfavorable shift of earnings weighted to jurisdictions with higher tax rates, by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations, by adverse rulings in tax related litigation, or by shortfalls in stock-based\\ncompensation realized by employees relative to stock-based compensation that was recorded for book purposes, among others.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nYear Ended May\\xa031,\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nPercent Change\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nPercent Change\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n (Dollars in millions)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2018\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nActual\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nConstant\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2017\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nActual\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nConstant\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2016\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Provision for income taxes\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa09,066\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0315%\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n315%\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa02,182\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0-14%\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n-15%\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa02,541\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Effective tax rate\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n70.3%\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n18.9%\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n22.2%\\n\\xa0\\n Fiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Provision for income taxes increased in\\nfiscal 2018, relative to fiscal 2017, primarily due to the net unfavorable impacts due to our initial accounting for the enactment of the Tax Act on January\\xa01, 2018 (refer to \\x93Impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\\x94 above\\nfor additional information) and, to a lesser extent, by the tax effect of higher income before provision for income taxes (determined after taking into account the net favorable impact of the Tax Act on our tax profile) during fiscal 2018; an\\nunfavorable shift in jurisdiction mix of earnings in fiscal 2018; and a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits due to settlements with tax authorities and other events during fiscal 2018. These unfavorable impacts to our provision for income taxes\\nwere partially offset by higher fiscal 2018 realized excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation expense.  Fiscal 2017 Compared\\nto Fiscal 2016:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Provision for income taxes in fiscal 2017 decreased relative to fiscal 2016 primarily due to the favorable impact of excess tax benefits recognized in fiscal 2017 that related to stock-based\\ncompensation, which were recorded as a benefit to provision for income taxes in fiscal 2017, in comparison to fiscal 2016 when such benefits were recognized as an increase to additional paid in capital. To a lesser extent, the provision for income\\ntaxes in fiscal 2017 also benefited from a favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings, as well as net favorable changes in fiscal 2017 relating to unrecognized tax benefits from audit settlements, statute of limitation releases, and other events. \\n\\n \\xa0 58 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n Liquidity and Capital Resources  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nAs of May\\xa031,\\n\\xa0\\n\\n (Dollars in millions)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2018\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nChange\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2017\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nChange\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2016\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Working capital\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa056,769\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n13%\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa050,337\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n7%\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa047,105\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n67,261\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2%\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n66,078\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n18%\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n56,125\\n\\xa0\\n Working capital:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The increase in working capital as of May\\xa031, 2018 in\\ncomparison to May\\xa031, 2017 was primarily due to our issuance of $10.0\\xa0billion of long-term senior notes in November 2017 (refer to Recent Financing Activities Below for additional information), the favorable impacts to our net current\\nassets resulting from our net income during fiscal 2018 and cash proceeds from stock option exercises. These favorable working capital movements were partially offset by cash used for repurchases of our common stock, cash used to pay dividends to\\nour stockholders, cash used for capital expenditures and cash used for acquisitions in fiscal 2018.  The increase in working capital as of\\nMay\\xa031, 2017 in comparison to May\\xa031, 2016 was primarily due to our issuance of $14.0\\xa0billion of long-term senior notes in July 2016, the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal 2017 and\\ncash proceeds from stock option exercises. These favorable working capital movements were partially offset by cash used for acquisitions, including $9.0\\xa0billion of net cash used for our acquisition of NetSuite in the second quarter of fiscal\\n2017, cash used for repurchases of our common stock, cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders and cash used for capital expenditures.  Our\\nworking capital may be impacted by some or all of the aforementioned factors in future periods, the amounts and timing of which are variable. \\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at\\nmajor banks, Tier-1 commercial paper and other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities consist of Tier-1 commercial paper debt\\nsecurities, corporate debt securities and certain other securities. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May\\xa031, 2018 in comparison to May\\xa031, 2017 was primarily due to the issuance of $12.5\\xa0billion of\\ncash inflows from fiscal 2018 debt issuances (refer to Recent Financing Activities Below for additional information), cash inflows generated by our operations and cash inflows from stock option exercises. These cash inflows were partially offset by\\ncertain fiscal 2018 cash outflows, primarily $11.3\\xa0billion of repurchases of our common stock, the repayment of $9.8\\xa0billion of borrowings, payments of cash dividends to our stockholders and cash used for capital expenditures. \\nAs a result of the enactment of the Tax Act on January\\xa01, 2018, we expect greater flexibility in accessing and utilizing our cash, cash equivalent\\nand marketable securities balances held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries, as well as prospective assets generated by these foreign subsidiaries\\x92 future earnings and profits. We believe we have sufficient cash, cash equivalent and\\nmarketable securities balances and access to additional capital resources, if required, to settle the $7.8\\xa0billion one-time transition tax described under \\x93Impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\\nof 2017\\x94 above.  The amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of\\nthe cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances held by our foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset\\nto which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report). As\\nthe U.S.\\xa0Dollar generally weakened against certain major international currencies during fiscal 2018, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for these subsidiaries increased on a net\\nbasis as of May\\xa031, 2018 relative to what we would have reported using constant currency rates from our May\\xa031, 2017 balance sheet date. \\nThe increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May\\xa031, 2017 in comparison to May\\xa031, 2016 was primarily due to cash\\ninflows generated by our operations during fiscal 2017, $13.6\\xa0billion of net cash inflows from fiscal 2017 debt issuances, net of debt repayments, and cash inflows from fiscal 2017 stock option \\n\\n \\xa0 59 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n \\nexercises. These fiscal 2017 cash inflows were partially offset by certain fiscal 2017 cash outflows, primarily acquisitions, including our acquisition of NetSuite, repurchases of our common\\nstock, payments of cash dividends to our stockholders, and cash used for capital expenditures. Additionally, our reported cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of May\\xa031, 2017 decreased on a net basis in comparison to\\nMay\\xa031, 2016 as the U.S.\\xa0Dollar generally strengthened in comparison to most major international currencies during fiscal 2017.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nYear Ended May\\xa031,\\n\\xa0\\n\\n (Dollars in millions)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2018\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nChange\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2017\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nChange\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2016\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Net cash provided by operating activities\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa015,386\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n9%\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa014,126\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n3%\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa013,685\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Net cash used for investing activities\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n(5,625\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n-74%\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n(21,494\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n317%\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n(5,154\\n)\\xa0\\n\\n Net cash (used for) provided by financing activities\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n(9,982\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n210%\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n9,086\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n-191%\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n(9,980\\n)\\xa0\\n Cash flows from operating activities:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our largest source of operating cash flows\\nis cash collections from our customers following the purchase and renewal of their license support agreements. Payments from customers for these support agreements are generally received near the beginning of the contracts\\x92 terms, which are\\ngenerally one year in length. Over the course of a fiscal year, we also have historically generated cash from the sales of new licenses, cloud services, hardware offerings and services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for\\nemployee related expenditures, material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware products, taxes and leased facilities. \\nFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Net cash provided by operating activities increased during fiscal 2018 primarily due\\nto higher net income after adjusting for the one-time income tax accounting effects of our adoption of the Tax Act (refer to \\x93Impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\\x94 for additional\\ndiscussion).  Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Net cash provided by operating activities increased during fiscal\\n2017 primarily due to the cash favorable effects of higher net income in fiscal 2017 in relation to fiscal 2016.  Cash flows from investing\\nactivities:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to our acquisitions, the timing of our purchases, maturities and sales of our investments in marketable debt securities and investments\\nin capital and other assets, including certain intangible assets, to support our growth.  Fiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017: Net\\ncash used for investing activities decreased in fiscal 2018 relative to fiscal 2017 primarily due to a decrease in net cash used for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and a decrease in cash used to purchase marketable securities and other\\ninvestments, net of proceeds received from sales and maturities.  Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Net\\ncash used for investing activities increased in fiscal 2017 relative to fiscal 2016 primarily due to an increase in cash used for acquisitions, net of cash acquired in fiscal 2017, an increase in cash used to purchase marketable securities and other\\ninvestments (net of proceeds received from sales and maturities) in fiscal 2017 and increased capital expenditures primarily related to our fiscal 2017 real estate purchases and investments in equipment to support our infrastructure to deliver our\\ncloud services.  Cash flows from financing activities:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The changes in cash flows from financing activities\\nprimarily relate to borrowings and repayments related to our debt instruments as well as stock repurchases, dividend payments and net proceeds related to employee stock programs. \\nFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Net cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2018 was $10.0\\xa0billion\\nin comparison to net cash provided by financing activities of $9.1\\xa0billion during fiscal 2017. The increase in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2018 was primarily due to increased stock repurchase activity in fiscal 2018 (we\\nused $11.3\\xa0billion in fiscal 2018 for stock repurchases in comparison to $3.6\\xa0billion in fiscal 2017) and debt related cash flows for which we had $2.6\\xa0billion of cash inflows from borrowings, net of repayments, in fiscal 2018 in\\ncomparison to $13.6\\xa0billion of cash inflows from borrowings, net of repayments, in fiscal 2017.

We received $13.6\\xa0billion of net cash inflows from borrowing activities during fiscal 2017 in comparison to $1.8\\xa0billion of net\\ncash inflows from fiscal 2016 borrowing activities. In addition, we significantly reduced our stock repurchase activity in fiscal 2017, using $3.6\\xa0billion, in comparison to fiscal 2016 when we used $10.4\\xa0billion. \\nFree cash flow:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to analyze cash flows generated from our operations. We believe that free cash flow is also useful as one of the\\nbases for comparing our performance with our competitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our\\nperformance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.

We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis\\nto financial institutions within 90 days of the contracts\\x92 dates of execution. We generally record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financing receivables because we are considered to have\\nsurrendered control of these financing receivables. We financed $1.5\\xa0billion in fiscal 2018, $912\\xa0million in 2017 and $1.2\\xa0billion in fiscal 2016, respectively, or approximately 24%, 14% and 16% of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Recent Financing Activities:\\n Cash Dividends:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In fiscal 2018, we declared and paid cash dividends of $0.76 per share that totaled\\n$3.1\\xa0billion. In June 2018, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share of our outstanding common stock payable on July\\xa031, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July\\xa017, 2018.\\nFuture declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors. \\nSwap Agreements:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In May 2018, we entered into certain cross-currency interest rate swap agreements to manage the foreign\\ncurrency exchange risk and interest rate risk associated with our \\x80750\\xa0million of 3.125% senior notes due July 2025 (July 2025 Notes) by effectively converting the fixed-rate, Euro\\ndenominated July 2025 Notes, including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to variable-rate, U.S.\\xa0Dollar denominated debt. The economic effect of the swap agreement was to eliminate the uncertainty of the\\nprincipal balance in U.S. Dollars associated with the July 2025 Notes by fixing the principal amount of the July 2025 Notes at $868\\xa0million and modify the related fixed interest obligations so that the interest payable on these notes became\\nvariable based on LIBOR. As of May\\xa031, 2018, our July 2025 Notes had an effective interest rate of 5.17% after considering the effects of the aforementioned cross-currency interest rate swap arrangement. We are accounting for these\\ncross-currency interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815).  In April 2018, we\\nentered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with our $1.5\\xa0billion of 6.50% senior notes due April 2038 (April 2038 Notes), so that the interest payable\\non these notes became variable based on LIBOR. As of May\\xa031, 2018, our April 2038 Notes had effective interest rates of 5.65% after considering the effects of the aforementioned interest rate swap arrangements. We are accounting for these\\ninterest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC\\xa0815. \\n \\xa0 61 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n Additional details regarding our senior notes and related interest rate swap agreements are included in\\nNotes 7 and 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report.  Revolving Credit\\nAgreements:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In May 2018, we entered into three revolving credit agreements with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as initial lender and administrative agent (the 2018 Credit Agreements) and borrowed $2.5\\xa0billion pursuant to\\nthese agreements. The 2018 Credit Agreements provided us with short-term borrowings for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Interest for the 2018 Credit Agreements is based on either (1)\\xa0a LIBOR-based formula or (2)\\xa0the\\nBase Rate formula, each as set forth in the 2018 Credit Agreements. The borrowings are due and payable on June\\xa028, 2018, which is the termination date of the 2018 Credit Agreements. Additional details regarding the 2018 Credit Agreements are\\nincluded in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.  Common Stock Repurchase\\nProgram:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. During fiscal 2018, our Board of Directors approved expansions of our stock repurchase program totaling\\n$24.0\\xa0billion. As of May\\xa031, 2018, approximately $17.8\\xa0billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 238.0\\xa0million shares for $11.5\\xa0billion, 85.6\\xa0million\\nshares for $3.5\\xa0billion, and 271.9\\xa0million shares for $10.4\\xa0billion in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend\\non factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be\\neffected from time to time through open market purchases and pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time. \\nSenior Notes:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In November 2017, we issued $10.0\\xa0billion of senior notes comprised of the following: \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n $1.25\\xa0billion of 2.625% senior notes due February 2023; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n $2.00\\xa0billion of 2.95% senior notes due November 2024; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n $2.75\\xa0billion of 3.25% senior notes due November 2027; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n $1.75\\xa0billion of 3.80% senior notes due November 2037; and \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n $2.25\\xa0billion of 4.00% senior notes due November 2047. \\nWe issued the senior notes for general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on our common stock,\\nrepayment of indebtedness and future acquisitions. Additionally, in fiscal 2018, we repaid $3.5\\xa0billion of senior notes pursuant to their terms. Additional details regarding our senior notes are included in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated\\nFinancial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.  Contractual Obligations:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The contractual\\nobligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under our fixed contractual obligations and commitments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates and other factors may result\\nin actual payments differing from these estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments. We have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in preparing this information within the context\\nof our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Interest payments on these senior notes have been presented in the table above after consideration of these fixed\\nto variable interest rate swap agreements based upon the interest rates applicable as of May\\xa031, 2018 and are subject to change in future periods;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n interest payments on our floating-rate senior notes that are based upon the interest rates applicable to the senior\\nnotes as of May\\xa031, 2018 and are subject to change in future periods;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n certain cross-currency swap agreements for our \\x801.25\\xa0billion\\n2.25% senior notes due 2021 that have the economic effect of converting our fixed-rate, Euro-denominated debt, including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate, U.S. Dollar-denominated debt with a fixed\\nannual interest rate. Principal and interest payments for these senior notes were calculated and presented in the table above based on the terms of these cross-currency swap agreements; and \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n certain cross-currency interest rate swap agreements for our\\n\\x80750\\xa0million 3.125% senior notes due July 2025 that have the economic effect of converting our fixed-rate, Euro-denominated debt, including annual interest payments and the payment of\\nprincipal at maturity, to a variable-rate, U.S. Dollar-denominated debt. Principal and interest payments for these senior notes were calculated and presented in the table above based on the terms of these cross-currency interest rate swap\\nagreements.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n Refer to Notes 7 and 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for\\nadditional information related to our notes payable and other borrowings and related derivative agreements.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n(2)\\xa0\\n Primarily represents leases of facilities and includes future minimum rent payments for facilities that we have vacated\\npursuant to our restructuring and merger integration activities. We have approximately $61\\xa0million in facility obligations, net of estimated sublease income, for certain vacated locations in accrued restructuring on our consolidated balance\\nsheet at May\\xa031, 2018.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n(3)\\xa0\\n Primarily represents amounts associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and specify terms,\\nincluding: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payment. We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture\\nsub-assemblies for our hardware products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished hardware products. We also obtain individual hardware components for our products from a variety of individual\\nsuppliers based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead-times and/or commercially standard\\nlead-times for the particular part or product and have been included in the amount presented in the above contractual obligations table. Routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to our external manufacturers and\\ncertain other suppliers and that are entered into in the ordinary course of business are not included in the amounts presented above, as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are difficult to\\nquantify in a meaningful way.  As of May\\xa031, 2018, we had $6.6\\xa0billion of gross unrecognized income tax benefits,\\nincluding related interest and penalties, recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, and all such obligations have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above due to the uncertainty as to when they might be settled. We cannot make a\\nreasonably reliable estimate of the period in which the remainder of our unrecognized income tax benefits will be settled or released with the relevant tax authorities, although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities\\ncould be settled or released during fiscal 2019. We are involved in claims and legal proceedings. All such claims and obligations have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above due to the uncertainty of claims and legal proceedings\\nand associated estimates and assumptions, all of which are inherently unpredictable and many aspects of which are out of our control. Notes 14 and 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report includes\\nadditional information regarding these contingencies.  We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash\\ngenerated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures and contractual obligation requirements, including the $7.8\\xa0billion one-time transition tax described under\\n\\x93Impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\\x94 above. In addition, we believe that we could fund our future acquisitions, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash equivalents\\nand marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future\\neffect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. \\n \\xa0 63 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n Selected Quarterly Financial Data \\nQuarterly revenues, expenses and operating income have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including the structure of sales\\nforce incentive compensation plans. In addition, our European operations generally provide lower revenues in our first fiscal quarter because of the reduced economic activity in Europe during the summer. These seasonal factors are common in the\\ntechnology industry. These factors have historically caused a decrease in our first quarter revenues as compared to revenues in the immediately preceding fourth quarter, which historically has been our highest revenue quarter within a particular\\nfiscal year. Similarly, the operating income of our business is affected by seasonal factors in a similar manner as our revenues (in particular, our cloud and license business and hardware business) as certain expenses within our cost structure are\\nrelatively fixed in the short term. We expect these trends to continue in fiscal 2019.  The following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly\\ninformation for our last eight fiscal quarters. We believe that all necessary adjustments, which consisted only of normal recurring adjustments, have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the results of such periods when read\\nin conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The sum of the quarterly financial information may vary from annual data due to rounding. \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nFiscal 2018 Quarter Ended (Unaudited)\\n\\xa0\\n\\n (in millions, except per share amounts)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nAugust\\xa031\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nNovember\\xa030\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nFebruary\\xa028\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nMay\\xa031\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Revenues\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n9,187\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n9,621\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n9,771\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa011,251\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Gross profit\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n7,254\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n7,656\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n7,769\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n9,071\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Operating income\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n2,821\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n3,069\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n3,410\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n4,380\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Net income (loss)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n2,210\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n2,233\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n(4,024\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n3,408\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Earnings (loss) per share\\x97basic\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.53\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.54\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n(0.98\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n0.84\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Earnings (loss) per share\\x97diluted\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.52\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.52\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n(0.98\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n0.82\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nFiscal 2017 Quarter Ended (Unaudited)\\n\\xa0\\n\\n (in millions, except per share amounts)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nAugust\\xa031\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nNovember\\xa030\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nFebruary\\xa028\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nMay\\xa031\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Revenues\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n8,595\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n9,035\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n9,205\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa010,892\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Gross profit\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n6,819\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n7,237\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n7,314\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n8,889\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Operating income\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n2,641\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n3,037\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n2,959\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n4,073\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Net income\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n1,832\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n2,032\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n2,239\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n3,231\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Earnings per share\\x97basic\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.44\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.50\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.55\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n0.78\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Earnings per share\\x97diluted\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.43\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.48\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.53\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n0.76\\n\\xa0\\n Restricted Stock-Based Awards and Stock Options \\nOur stock-based compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees\\nand align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders.  We recognize that restricted stock-based awards and stock options dilute\\nexisting stockholders and have sought to control the number of stock-based awards granted while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June\\xa01, 2015 has been a\\nweighted-average annualized rate of 1.7%\\xa0per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new restricted stock-based awards or stock options granted and assumed, net of restricted stock-based awards and stock\\noptions forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by the weighted-average outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all restricted stock-based awards vest and stock options are\\nexercised. Of the outstanding stock options at May\\xa031, 2018, which generally have a ten-year exercise period, approximately 19% have exercise prices higher than the market price of our common stock on\\nsuch date. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock-based compensation program. However, we may modify the levels of our stock repurchases in the future depending on a number of factors,\\nincluding the amount of cash we have available for acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes. At May\\xa031, 2018, the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding restricted stock-based awards and\\n\\n \\xa0 64 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n \\nunexercised stock options, regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including stock options where the strike price is higher than the market price as of such\\ndate, was 9.8%.  During fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviewed and approved the annual organization-wide\\nstock-based award grants to selected employees, all stock-based award grants to executive officers and any individual grant of restricted stock units of 62,500 or greater. Each member of a separate executive officer committee, referred to as the\\nPlan Committee, was allocated a fiscal 2018 equity budget that could be used throughout the fiscal year to grant equity within his or her organization, subject to certain limitations established by the Compensation Committee. \\nRestricted stock-based award and stock option activity from June\\xa01, 2015 through May\\xa031, 2018 is summarized as follows (shares in millions):\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Restricted stock-based awards and stock options outstanding at May\\xa031, 2015\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n441\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Restricted stock-based awards and stock options granted\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n240\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Restricted stock-based awards and stock options assumed\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n17\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Restricted stock-based awards vested and issued and stock options exercised\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(260\\n)\\xa0\\n\\n Forfeitures, cancellations and other, net\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(45\\n)\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Restricted stock-based awards and stock options outstanding at May\\xa031, 2018\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n393\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Weighted-average annualized restricted stock-based awards and stock options granted and assumed, net of\\nforfeitures and cancellations\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n70\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Weighted-average annualized stock repurchases\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(199\\n)\\xa0\\n\\n Shares outstanding at May\\xa031, 2018\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n3,997\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Basic weighted-average shares outstanding from June\\xa01, 2015 through May\\xa031, 2018\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n4,152\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Restricted stock-based awards and stock options outstanding as a percent of shares outstanding at\\nMay\\xa031, 2018\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n9.8%\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Total restricted stock-based awards and in the money stock options outstanding (based on the closing price\\nof our common stock on the last trading day of fiscal 2018) as a percent of shares outstanding at May\\xa031, 2018\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n8.4%\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Weighted-average annualized restricted stock-based awards and stock options granted and assumed, net of\\nforfeitures and cancellations and before stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted-average shares outstanding from June\\xa01, 2015 through May\\xa031, 2018\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n1.7%\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Weighted-average annualized restricted stock-based awards and stock options granted and assumed, net of\\nforfeitures and cancellations and after stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted-average shares outstanding from June\\xa01, 2015 through May\\xa031, 2018\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n-3.1%\\n\\xa0\\n Our Compensation Committee approves the annual organization-wide stock-based award grants to certain employees.

Our\\nbank deposits and time deposits are generally held with large, diverse financial institutions worldwide with high investment-grade credit ratings or financial institutions that meet investment-grade ratings criteria, which we believe mitigates\\ncredit risk and certain other risks. In addition, as of May\\xa031, 2018, substantially all of our marketable securities were high quality with approximately 26% having maturity dates within one year and 74% having maturity dates within one to five\\nyears (a description of our marketable securities held is included in Notes\\xa03 and 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report and \\x93Liquidity and Capital Resources\\x94 above). We held a mix of\\nboth fixed and floating-rate debt securities. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted as interest rates increase, \\n \\xa0 65 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n \\nwhile floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may vary due to changes in interest rates\\nor we may realize losses if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However because we classify our debt securities as \\x93available for sale,\\x94 no gains or losses are recognized due to\\nchanges in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. The fair values of our fixed-rate debt securities are impacted by interest rate movements and if\\ninterest rates would have been higher by 50 basis points as of May\\xa031, 2018 and 2017 we estimate the change would have decreased the fair values of our marketable securities holdings by $308\\xa0million and $348\\xa0million, respectively.\\nSubstantially all of our marketable securities are designated as available-for-sale. We generally do not use our investments for trading purposes. \\nChanges in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.\\nFor fiscal 2018 and 2017, total interest income was $1.2\\xa0billion and $802\\xa0million, respectively, with our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities investments yielding an average 1.73% and 1.47%, respectively, on a worldwide basis.\\n Interest Expense Risk  Interest Expense\\nRisk\\x97Interest Rate Swap Agreements and Cross-Currency Interest Rate Swap Agreements  Our total borrowings were\\n$60.9\\xa0billion as of May\\xa031, 2018, consisting of $56.9\\xa0billion of fixed-rate borrowings, $1.2\\xa0billion of floating-rate borrowings (Floating-Rate Notes) and $2.8\\xa0billion of other borrowings, primarily under the 2018 Credit\\nAgreements. We have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with our $1.5\\xa0billion of 2.375% senior notes due January 2019 (January 2019 Notes), our\\n$2.0\\xa0billion of 2.25% senior notes due October 2019 (October 2019 Notes), our $1.5\\xa0billion of 2.80% senior notes due July 2021 (July 2021 Notes), and our April 2038 Notes, so that the interest payable on these senior notes effectively\\nbecame variable based on LIBOR. We have also entered into cross-currency interest rate swap agreements to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our July 2025 Notes by effectively converting the fixed-rate, Euro denominated\\ndebt, including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to variable-rate, U.S.\\xa0Dollar denominated debt based on LIBOR. The critical terms of the swap agreements match the critical terms of the January 2019 Notes,\\nOctober 2019 Notes, July 2021 Notes, April 2038 Notes and July 2025 Notes that the swap agreements pertain to, including the notional amounts and maturity dates. We do not use these swap arrangements for trading purposes. We are accounting for these\\nswap agreements as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815). The fair values of these fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements as of May\\xa031, 2018 and 2017 were a $26\\xa0million net loss and a\\n$40\\xa0million gain, respectively. We estimate that the changes in the fair values of these swap agreements during fiscal 2018 and 2017 were primarily attributable to an increase in forward interest rate prices. If LIBOR-based interest rates would\\nhave been higher by 100 basis points as of May\\xa031, 2018 and 2017, the change would have decreased the fair values of the fixed to variable swap agreements by $315\\xa0million and $153\\xa0million, respectively. \\nBy issuing the Floating-Rate Notes and by entering into the aforementioned swap arrangements, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest\\nrates based upon LIBOR.\\xa0Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations.\\xa0An interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate\\nrisk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest rates. As of May\\xa031, 2018 and 2017, if LIBOR-based interest rates would have been higher by 100 basis points, the change would have increased\\nour interest expense annually by approximately $86\\xa0million and $73\\xa0million, respectively, as it relates to our fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements and floating-rate borrowings. Additional details regarding our senior notes and\\nrelated swap agreements are included in Notes 7 and 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. \\n \\xa0 66 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n Currency Risk  Foreign\\nCurrency Transaction Risk\\x97Foreign Currency Forward Contracts  We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established\\na program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that\\nincreases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions. We may suspend this\\nprogram from time to time. Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees, intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. \\nNeither do we use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments\\npursuant to ASC 815. Accordingly, we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statement of operations. Given the short\\nduration of the forward contracts, amounts recorded generally are not significant. The balance sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is prepaid expenses and other current assets for forward contracts in an unrealized\\ngain position and other current liabilities for forward contracts in an unrealized loss position. The statement of operations classification for changes in fair values of these forward contracts is\\nnon-operating income, net for both realized and unrealized gains and losses.  We expect that we will\\ncontinue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally\\ndepend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other\\nfactors. The notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $3.4\\xa0billion as of each of May\\xa031, 2018 and 2017 and the notional amounts of forward\\ncontracts we held to sell U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $1.4\\xa0billion as of each of May\\xa031, 2018 and 2017. The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal at\\nMay\\xa031, 2018 and 2017. Net foreign exchange transaction losses included in non-operating income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $74\\xa0million, $152\\xa0million and\\n$110\\xa0million in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As a large portion of our consolidated operations are international, we could experience additional foreign currency volatility in the future, the amounts and timing of which are\\nunknown.  Foreign Currency Translation Risk\\x97Impact on Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities \\nFluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation\\nof these amounts into U.S. Dollars. In particular, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by these subsidiaries is subject to translation variance\\ncaused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheets and is also presented as\\na line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report).  As the U.S.\\xa0Dollar fluctuated\\nagainst certain international currencies as of the end of fiscal 2018, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for foreign subsidiaries that hold international currencies as of May\\xa031,\\n2018 increased relative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate from May\\xa031, 2017. As reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, the estimated effects of exchange rate changes on our reported cash and cash\\nequivalents balances in U.S. Dollars was an increase of $57\\xa0million for fiscal 2018, and decreases of $86\\xa0million and $115\\xa0million in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. If overall foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the\\nU.S.\\xa0Dollar uniformly would have been weaker by 10% as of May\\xa031, 2018 and May\\xa031, 2017 the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities we would report in U.S. Dollars would have decreased by approximately\\n$555\\xa0million and $518\\xa0million, respectively, assuming constant foreign currency cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances. \\n \\xa0 67 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n Item\\xa08.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Financial Statements and Supplementary Data \\nThe response to this item is submitted as a separate section of this Annual Report.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive Officers (one of whom is our\\nPrincipal Financial Officer), we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May\\xa031, 2018 based on the guidelines established in Internal Control\\x97Integrated Framework issued by\\nthe Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\\x92s 2013 framework. Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial\\nreporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  Based on the results of our\\nevaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May\\xa031, 2018. We reviewed the results of management\\x92s assessment with our Finance and Audit Committee. \\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May\\xa031, 2018 has been audited by Ernst\\xa0& Young LLP, an\\nindependent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report. \\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting \\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d)\\xa0of\\nExchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our\\ninternal control over financial reporting.  Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls \\nOur management, including our Principal Executive Officers (one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer), believes that our disclosure controls and\\nprocedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed \\n \\xa0 68 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n \\nto provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and\\nprocedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control\\nsystem are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no\\nevaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns\\ncan occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls\\nalso is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become\\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be\\ndetected.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company at\\nMay\\xa031, 2018 and 2017, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May\\xa031, 2018, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\\x92s\\ninternal control over financial reporting as of May\\xa031, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report\\ndated June\\xa022, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.  Basis for Opinion \\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\\x92s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\\x92s\\nfinancial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the\\nfinancial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing\\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \\n/s/ Ernst\\xa0& Young LLP  We have served as the\\nCompany\\x92s auditor since 2002.

In our opinion, Oracle Corporation (the Company)\\nmaintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May\\xa031, 2018, based on the COSO criteria.  We\\nalso have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of May\\xa031, 2018 and 2017, and the related consolidated statements of\\noperations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May\\xa031, 2018, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2 and our report June\\xa022,\\n2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.  Basis for Opinion \\nThe Company\\x92s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the\\neffectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management\\x92s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\\x92s internal control over\\nfinancial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those\\nstandards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,\\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis\\nfor our opinion.  Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \\nA company\\x92s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial\\nreporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\\x92s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that\\n(1)\\xa0pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)\\xa0provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as\\nnecessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors\\nof the company; and (3)\\xa0provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\\x92s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any\\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \\n/s/ Ernst\\xa0& Young LLP  San Jose, California \\nJune\\xa022, 2018 \\n \\xa0 73 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial

\\nOracle Corporation provides products and services that address all aspects of corporate information technology (IT) environments\\x97applications,\\nplatform and infrastructure. Our applications, platform and infrastructure offerings are delivered to customers worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models, including cloud-based,\\non-premise, or hybrid, which enable customer choice and flexibility. Our Oracle Cloud offerings provide a comprehensive and fully integrated stack of applications, platform, compute, storage and networking\\nservices in all three primary layers of the cloud: Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Our Oracle Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings (collectively, \\x93Oracle Cloud Services\\x94)\\nintegrate the software, hardware and services on customers\\x92 behalf in IT environments that we deploy, support and manage for the customer. We offer our customers the option to deploy our comprehensive set of cloud offerings including Oracle\\nCloud Services or to purchase our software and hardware products and related services to manage their own cloud-based or on-premise IT environments. Customers that purchase our software products may elect to\\npurchase license support contracts, which provide our customers with rights to unspecified license upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period as well as technical support assistance. Customers that purchase our hardware\\nproducts may elect to purchase hardware support contracts, which provide customers with software updates and can include product repairs, maintenance services, and technical support services. We also offer customers a broad set of services offerings\\nthat are designed to improve customer utilization of their investments in Oracle applications, platform and infrastructure technologies.  Oracle\\nCorporation conducts business globally and was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun in June 1977. \\nBasis of Financial Statements  The consolidated financial\\nstatements included our accounts and the accounts of our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. Noncontrolling interest positions of certain of our consolidated entities are reported as a separate component of consolidated equity from the equity\\nattributable to Oracle\\x92s stockholders for all periods presented. The noncontrolling interests in our net income were not significant to our consolidated results for the periods presented and therefore have been included as a component of non-operating income, net in our consolidated statements of operations. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Certain other prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current\\nyear presentation. Such reclassifications did not affect total revenues, operating income or net income.  In fiscal 2018, we adopted Accounting\\nStandards Update (ASU) No.\\xa02017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment (ASU 2017-04). The ASU\\nsimplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. Under the legacy guidance, Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test required entities to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill in the same\\nmanner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination by assigning the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. The carrying value in excess of the implied fair value was recognized\\nas goodwill impairment. Under the new standard, goodwill impairment is recognized as the carrying value in excess of the reporting unit\\x92s fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. ASU 2017-04 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  Impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\\nof 2017  The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2018 compared to the corresponding prior year periods, and of our consolidated\\nbalance sheets as of May\\xa031, 2018 relative to May\\xa031, 2017, was impacted by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act), which was signed into law on December\\xa022, 2017. Effective January\\xa01, 2018, the Tax Act reduces the\\nU.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%; creates a quasi-territorial tax \\n \\xa0 79 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued) \\nMay 31, 2018  \\xa0\\n \\nsystem that a) generally allows, among other provisions, companies to repatriate certain foreign source earnings without incurring additional U.S. income tax for such earnings generated after\\nDecember\\xa031, 2017 and b) generally requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain foreign subsidiary earnings generated prior to December\\xa031, 2017 that, in substantial part, were\\npreviously tax deferred; creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings; limits deductibility of certain future compensation arrangements to certain highly compensated employees; and provides tax incentives for the exportation of U.S.\\nproducts to foreign jurisdictions and for the purchase of qualifying capital equipment, among other provisions.  Because we have a May\\xa031\\nfiscal year end, our fiscal 2018 blended U.S. federal statutory tax rate was approximately 29%.  During fiscal 2018, our provision for income taxes\\nincreased and our net income decreased, primarily as a result of the following items related to the enactment of the Tax Act:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n $7.8\\xa0billion of income tax expense, which we refined by a $166\\xa0million increase as of May\\xa031, 2018 from\\nour initial estimate made in our third quarter of fiscal 2018 in accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin No.\\xa0118 (SAB 118), related to the application of the\\none-time transition tax to certain foreign subsidiary earnings that were generated prior to December\\xa031, 2017 and for which such expense was substantially recorded to\\nnon-current income taxes payable in our consolidated balance sheet and corresponds to the amount we currently expect to periodically settle over an eight year period as provided by the Tax Act;\\n partially offset by:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n $820\\xa0million of income tax benefit, which we refined by a $76\\xa0million increase as of May\\xa031, 2018 from\\nour initial estimate made in our third quarter of fiscal 2018 in accordance with SAB 118, related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future; and\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the net favorable impacts of the Tax Act on our tax profile and effective tax rate beginning on January\\xa01, 2018,\\nwhich we generally expect will continue into future periods.  The net expense related to the enactment of the Tax Act has been\\naccounted for during fiscal 2018 based on provisional estimates pursuant to SAB 118. Subsequent adjustments, if any, will be accounted for in the period such adjustments are identified. The provisional estimates incorporate, among other factors,\\nassumptions made based on interpretations of the Tax Act and existing tax laws and a range of historical financial and tax-specific facts and information, including among other items, the amount of cash and\\nother specified assets and liabilities of the company and its foreign subsidiaries on relevant dates and estimates of deferred tax balances pending finalization of those balances. \\nUse of Estimates  Our consolidated financial statements\\nare prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board\\x92s (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), and we consider the various staff accounting\\nbulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the SEC. These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based\\nupon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as\\nwell as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent that there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our consolidated financial statements will be\\naffected. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management\\x92s judgment in its \\n \\xa0 80 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued) \\nMay 31, 2018  \\xa0\\n \\napplication. There are also areas in which management\\x92s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. \\nRevenue Recognition  Our sources of revenues include:\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n cloud and license revenues, which include the sale of: cloud services and license support; and cloud license and on-premise licenses, which represent licenses purchased by customers for use in both cloud and on-premise deployments; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n hardware revenues, which include the sale of hardware products including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, and\\nstorage products, and industry-specific hardware; and hardware support revenues; and  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n services revenues, which are earned from providing cloud-, license- and hardware-related services including\\nconsulting, advanced customer support and education services.  Revenue Recognition for Cloud Services Offerings, Hardware\\nProducts, Hardware Support and Related Services (Non-software Elements)  Our revenue recognition policy\\nfor non-software deliverables including our cloud services offerings, hardware products, hardware support and related services is based upon the accounting guidance contained in ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition, Multiple-Element Arrangements, and we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of cloud services revenues, hardware products\\nrevenues, hardware support and related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period.  Revenues from the sales of our non-software elements are recognized when: (1)\\xa0persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2)\\xa0we deliver the products or services; (3)\\xa0the sale price is fixed or determinable; and\\n(4)\\xa0collection is reasonably assured. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met. \\nRevenues for our cloud services offerings sold on a subscription basis are generally recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date\\nthe service is made available to customers. Revenues for cloud services offerings sold on a usage basis are generally recognized as the customer consumes the service, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. \\nRevenues from the sale of hardware products are generally recognized upon delivery of the hardware product to the customer provided all other revenue\\nrecognition criteria are satisfied. Hardware support contracts are entered into at the customer\\x92s option and are recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangements, which is typically one year, provided all other revenue\\nrecognition criteria have been satisfied.  Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements\\x97Cloud Services Offerings, Hardware Products, Hardware\\nSupport and Related Services (Non-software Arrangements)  We enter into arrangements with customers\\nthat purchase non-software related products and services from us at the same time, or within close proximity of one another (referred to as non-software multiple-element\\narrangements). Each element within a non-software multiple-element arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting provided the following criteria are met: the delivered products or services have\\nvalue to the customer on a standalone basis; and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services, delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service is considered probable and is\\nsubstantially controlled by us. We consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by us or another vendor or could be resold by the customer. Further, our revenue arrangements generally do not include a\\ngeneral right of return relative to the delivered products. \\n \\xa0 81 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued) \\nMay 31, 2018  \\xa0\\n \\nWhere the aforementioned criteria for a separate unit of accounting are not met, the deliverable is combined with the undelivered element(s) and treated as a single unit of accounting for the\\npurposes of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition. For those units of accounting that include more than one deliverable but are treated as a single unit of accounting, we generally recognize revenues over the\\ncontractual period of the arrangement, or in the case of our cloud services offerings, we generally recognize revenues over the contractual term of the cloud services subscription. For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are\\naccounted for as a single unit of accounting, we allocate revenue to the respective revenue line items within our consolidated statements of operations based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of relative selling\\nprices of such elements.  For our non-software multiple-element arrangements, we allocate revenue to each\\nelement based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangement\\x92s inception. The selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy: vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) if available, third-party evidence\\n(TPE) if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE are available (a description as to how we determine VSOE, TPE and ESP is provided below). If a tangible hardware product includes software, we determine whether\\nthe tangible hardware product and the software work together to deliver the product\\x92s essential functionality and, if so, the entire product is treated as a non-software deliverable. The total arrangement\\nconsideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the non-software deliverables using the relative selling prices of each unit based on the selling price hierarchy. We limit the amount\\nof revenue recognized for delivered elements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional products or services or meeting of any specified performance conditions. \\nWhen possible, we establish VSOE of selling price for deliverables in software and non-software\\nmultiple-element arrangements using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately. TPE is established by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated customers.\\nIf we are unable to determine the selling price because VSOE or TPE does not exist, we determine ESP for the purposes of allocating the arrangement by reviewing historical transactions, including transactions whereby the deliverable was sold on a\\nstandalone basis and considering several other external and internal factors.  Revenue Recognition for Cloud License and On-Premise License and License Related Services (Software Elements)  The basis for our cloud license and on-premise license revenues and related services revenue recognition is substantially governed by the accounting guidance contained in ASC 985-605, Software-Revenue\\nRecognition. We exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of cloud license and on-premise license revenues and related services revenues to be recognized in\\neach accounting period.  For license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying license, we\\nrecognize cloud license and on-premise license revenues when: (1)\\xa0we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software; (2)\\xa0we deliver the products; (3)\\xa0the\\nsale price is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties; and (4)\\xa0collection is probable. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of license sale because the foregoing conditions are not met, are generally\\nrecognized when those conditions are subsequently met.  The vast majority of our cloud license and\\non-premise license arrangements include license support contracts, which are entered into at the customer\\x92s option. We recognize the related fees ratably over the term of the arrangement, typically one\\nyear. License support contracts provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period and include internet access to technical content, as well as\\ninternet and telephone access to technical support personnel. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net cloud license and \\n \\xa0 82 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued) \\nMay 31, 2018  \\xa0\\n \\non-premise license fees and are generally invoiced in full at the beginning of the support term. Substantially all of our customers renew their license\\nsupport contracts annually.  Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements\\x97Cloud License and On-Premise\\nLicense, Support and Related Services (Software Arrangements)  We often enter into arrangements with customers that purchase cloud licenses and\\non-premise licenses, license support and related services from us at the same time, or within close proximity of one another (referred to as software related multiple-element arrangements). For those software\\nrelated multiple-element arrangements, we have applied the residual method to determine the amount of cloud license and on-premise license revenues to be recognized pursuant to ASC 985-605. Under the residual method, if VSOE exists for undelivered elements in a multiple-element arrangement, VSOE of the undelivered elements is deferred with the remaining portion of the arrangement consideration\\ngenerally recognized upon delivery of the license. Where VSOE does not exist for the undelivered element in such arrangement, no revenue is recognized until the earlier of the point in time at which 1) VSOE has been established for such element; or\\n2) the element that does not have VSOE has been delivered.  Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements\\x97Arrangements with\\nSoftware and Non-software Elements  We also enter into multiple-element arrangements that may include a\\ncombination of our various software related and non-software related products and services offerings including cloud licenses and on-premise licenses, license support,\\ncloud services offerings, hardware products, hardware support, consulting, advanced customer support services and education. In such arrangements, we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative selling prices of the\\nsoftware group of elements as a whole and the non-software group of elements. We then further allocate consideration within the software group to the respective elements within that group following the\\nguidance in ASC 985-605 and our policies as described above. In addition, we allocate the consideration within the non-software group to each respective element within\\nthat group based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangement\\x92s inception as described above. After the arrangement consideration has been allocated to the software group of elements and non-software\\ngroup of elements, we account for each respective element in the arrangement as described above and below.  Other Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to\\nSoftware and Non-software Elements  Many of our cloud license and\\non-premise license arrangements include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts and are included as a part of our services business. Consulting revenues from\\nthese arrangements are generally accounted for separately from cloud license and on-premise license revenues because the arrangements qualify as services transactions as defined in ASC 985-605. The more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenues should be accounted for separately include the nature of services (i.e., consideration of whether the services are essential to\\nthe functionality of the licensed product), degree of risk, availability of services from other vendors, timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the license fee. Revenues for consulting services are\\ngenerally recognized as the services are performed.  If an arrangement contains multiple elements and does not qualify for separate accounting for\\nthe product and service transactions, then cloud license and on-premise license revenues and/or hardware products revenues, including the costs of hardware products, are generally recognized together with the\\nservices based on contract accounting using either the percentage-of-completion or completed-contract method. \\nWe also evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing \\x93fiscal funding\\x94 or \\x93termination for convenience\\x94 provisions,\\nwhen such provisions are required by law, to determine the probability of possible \\n \\xa0 83 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued) \\nMay 31, 2018  \\xa0\\n \\ncancellation. We consider multiple factors, including the history with the customer in similar transactions, the \\x93essential use\\x94 of the license or hardware products and the planning,\\nbudgeting and approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity. If we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is remote, we then recognize revenues for such arrangements once all of the criteria\\ndescribed above have been met. If such a determination cannot be made, revenues are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity for such arrangements. \\nWe assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenues if all other revenue recognition requirements are met. Our\\nstandard payment terms are net 30 days. However, payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed. We evaluate non-standard payment terms based on whether we have successful\\ncollection history on comparable arrangements (based upon similarity of customers, products, and arrangement economics) and, if so, generally conclude such payment terms are fixed and determinable and thereby satisfy the required criteria for\\nrevenue recognition.  While most of our arrangements for sales within our businesses include short-term payment terms, we have a standard practice\\nof providing long-term financing to creditworthy customers primarily through our financing division. Since fiscal 1989, when our financing division was formed, we have established a history of collection, without concessions, on these receivables\\nwith payment terms that generally extend up to five years from the contract date. Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, we recognize cloud license and on-premise license revenues and\\nhardware products revenues for these arrangements upon delivery, net of any payment discounts from financing transactions. We have generally sold receivables financed through our financing division on a\\nnon-recourse basis to third-party financing institutions within 90 days of the contracts\\x92 dates of execution and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our\\nconsolidated statements of cash flows. We account for the sales of these receivables as \\x93true sales\\x94 as defined in ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing, as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables.\\n Our customers include several of our suppliers and, occasionally, we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendors at or\\nabout the same time that we have sold our products to these same companies (Concurrent Transactions). License agreements, sales of hardware or sales of services that occur within a common time period from the date we have purchased goods or services\\nfrom that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure. When we acquire goods or services from a customer, we negotiate the purchase separately from any sales transaction, at terms we consider to be at arm\\x92s\\nlength and settle the purchase in cash. We recognize revenues from Concurrent Transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are met and the goods and services acquired are necessary for our current operations. \\nBusiness Combinations  We apply the provisions of ASC\\n805, Business Combinations, in accounting for our acquisitions. ASC 805 requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date\\nis measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and\\nliabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the\\nacquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities\\nassumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. \\n \\xa0 84 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued) \\nMay 31, 2018  \\xa0\\n Costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company or our internal operations are\\naccounted for as termination and exit costs pursuant to ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations, and are accounted for separately from the business combination. A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is\\nrecognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred. When estimating the fair value of facility restructuring activities, assumptions are applied regarding estimated sub-lease payments to be received, which can differ materially from actual results. This may require us to revise our initial estimates which may materially affect our results of operations and financial position in\\nthe period the revision is made.  For a given acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition\\ncontingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess\\nwhether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts. \\nIf we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a pre-acquisition contingency (non-income tax related) by the end of the measurement period, which is generally the case given the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such\\npre-acquisition contingency if: (1)\\xa0it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and (2)\\xa0the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably\\nestimated. Subsequent to the measurement period, changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position. \\nIn addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as\\nof the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement\\nperiod. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance\\x92s or contingency\\x92s estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will\\naffect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. \\nMarketable and Non-Marketable Securities \\nIn accordance with ASC 320, Investments\\x97Debt and Equity Securities, and based on our intentions regarding these instruments, we\\nclassify substantially all of our marketable debt and equity securities as available-for-sale. Marketable debt and equity securities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value, with all unrealized gains (losses) reflected net of tax in stockholders\\x92 equity on our consolidated balance sheets, and as\\na line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. If we determine that an investment has an other than temporary decline in fair value, we recognize the investment loss in non-operating\\nincome, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. We periodically evaluate our investments to determine if impairment charges are required. Substantially all of our marketable debt and equity investments are classified as\\ncurrent based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.  We hold investments in certain non-marketable equity securities in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence. These equity securities are recorded at cost and included in other\\nnon-current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. If based on the terms of our ownership of these non-marketable securities, we determine that we\\nexercise significant influence on the entity to which these non-marketable securities relate, we apply the requirements of ASC 323, Investments\\x97Equity Method and Joint Ventures, to\\naccount for such investments. Our non-marketable securities are subject to periodic impairment reviews. \\n \\xa0 85 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued) \\nMay 31, 2018  \\xa0\\n Fair Values of Financial Instruments \\nWe apply the provisions of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (ASC 820), to our assets and liabilities that we are required to measure at fair\\nvalue pursuant to other accounting standards, including our investments in marketable debt and equity securities and our derivative financial instruments. \\nThe additional disclosures regarding our fair value measurements are included in Note 4. \\nAllowances for Doubtful Accounts  We record allowances\\nfor doubtful accounts based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices. For those invoices not specifically reviewed, provisions are provided at differing rates, based upon the age of the receivable, the collection history\\nassociated with the geographic region that the receivable was recorded in and current economic trends. We write-off a receivable and charge it against its recorded allowance when we have exhausted our\\ncollection efforts without success.  Concentrations of Risk \\nFinancial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable\\nsecurities, derivatives and trade receivables. Our cash and cash equivalents are generally held with large, diverse financial institutions worldwide to reduce the amount of exposure to any single financial institution. Investment policies have been\\nimplemented that limit purchases of marketable debt securities to investment-grade securities. Our derivative contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standings and any exposure to counterparty credit-related\\nlosses in these contracts is largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of these contracts fluctuate from contractually established thresholds. We generally do\\nnot require collateral to secure accounts receivable. The risk with respect to trade receivables is mitigated by credit evaluations we perform on our customers, the short duration of our payment terms for the significant majority of our customer\\ncontracts and by the diversification of our customer base. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues in fiscal 2018, 2017 or 2016. \\nWe outsource the manufacturing, assembly and delivery of certain of our hardware products to a variety of companies, many of which are located outside\\nthe United States. Further, we have simplified our supply chain processes by reducing the number of third-party manufacturing partners and the number of locations where these third-party manufacturers build our hardware products. Any inability of\\nthese third-party manufacturing partners to deliver the contracted services for our hardware products could adversely impact future operating results of our hardware business. \\nInventories  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost\\nor net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost, which approximates actual cost, on a first-in, first-out basis. We evaluate our ending inventories for\\nestimated excess quantities and obsolescence. This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand within specific time horizons (generally six to nine months). Inventories in excess of future demand are\\nwritten down and charged to hardware expenses. In addition, we assess the impact of changing technology to our inventories and we write down inventories that are considered obsolete. At the point of loss recognition, a new, lower-cost basis for that\\ninventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. Inventories are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated\\nbalance sheets and totaled $398\\xa0million and $300\\xa0million at May\\xa031, 2018 and 2017, respectively. \\n \\xa0 86 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued) \\nMay 31, 2018  \\xa0\\n Other Receivables \\nOther receivables represent value-added tax and sales tax receivables associated with the sale of our products and services to third parties. Other\\nreceivables are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets and totaled $802\\xa0million and $794\\xa0million at May\\xa031, 2018 and 2017, respectively. \\nDeferred Sales Commissions  We defer sales commission\\nexpenses associated with our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, and recognize the related expenses over the non-cancelable terms of the related contracts, which are typically one to three years. The current\\nportion of the deferred sales commissions balances are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and the non-current portion of the deferred sales commissions balances are included in other assets\\nas of May\\xa031, 2018 and 2017. Amortization of deferred sales commissions is included as a component of sales and marketing expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. \\nProperty, Plant and Equipment  Property, plant and\\nequipment are stated at the lower of cost or realizable value, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from one to 40 years. Leasehold\\nimprovements are amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the lease terms, as appropriate. Property, plant and equipment are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances\\nindicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We did not recognize any significant property impairment charges in fiscal 2018, 2017 or 2016. \\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets and Impairment Assessments \\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired.\\nIntangible assets that are not considered to have an indefinite useful life are amortized over their useful lives, which generally range from one to 10 years. Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible\\nassets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization.  The carrying amounts of our\\ngoodwill and intangible assets are periodically reviewed for impairment (at least annually for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets) and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not\\nbe recoverable. When goodwill is assessed for impairment, we have the option to perform an assessment of qualitative factors of impairment (optional assessment) prior to necessitating a quantitative impairment test. Should the optional assessment be\\nused for any given fiscal year, qualitative factors to consider include cost factors; financial performance; legal, regulatory, contractual, political, business, or other factors; entity specific factors; industry and market considerations,\\nmacroeconomic conditions, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then\\nperformed. Otherwise, no further testing is required. For those reporting units tested using a quantitative approach, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. To determine\\nthe fair value of each reporting unit we utilize estimates, judgments and assumptions including estimated future cash flows the reporting unit is expected to generate on a discounted basis, future economic and market conditions, and market\\ncomparable of peer companies, among others. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, impairment is recognized for the difference, limited to the amount of goodwill recognized for the\\nreporting unit. We did not recognize any goodwill impairment charges in fiscal 2018, 2017 or 2016.  Recoverability of finite lived intangible\\nassets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. Recoverability of indefinite lived \\n \\xa0 87 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued) \\nMay 31, 2018  \\xa0\\n \\nintangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the\\ndifference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2018, 2017 or 2016. \\nDerivative Financial Instruments  During fiscal 2018,\\n2017 and 2016, we used derivative and non-derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency and interest rate risks (see Note 10 below for additional information). We account for these instruments in\\naccordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815), which requires that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value as of the reporting date. ASC 815 also\\nrequires that changes in our derivatives\\x92 fair values be recognized in earnings, unless specific hedge accounting and documentation criteria are met (i.e., the instruments are accounted for as hedges). \\nThe accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For a\\nderivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge, loss or gain attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized in earnings in the period of change with a corresponding offset recorded to the item for which the risk is being hedged. For a\\nderivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge, each reporting period we record the change in fair value on the effective portion of the derivative to accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets, and an amount is\\nreclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings to offset the earnings impact that is attributable to the risk being hedged. For the non-derivative financial instrument that was\\ndesignated as a net investment hedge for our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries, the change on account of remeasurement of the effective portion for each reporting period was recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in\\nour consolidated balance sheets until the net investment is sold, at which time the amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to non-operating income, net. \\nWe perform the effectiveness testing of our aforementioned designated hedges on a quarterly basis and material changes in ineffective portions of the\\nderivatives, if any, are recognized immediately in earnings.  Legal and Other Contingencies \\nWe are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential\\nfinancial exposure. Descriptions of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination are provided under \\x93Business Combinations\\x94 above. For legal and other contingencies that are not a part\\nof a business combination or related to income taxes, we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Note 17 below provides\\nadditional information regarding certain of our legal contingencies.  Shipping and Handling Costs \\nOur shipping and handling costs for hardware products sales are included in hardware expenses for all periods presented. \\nForeign Currency  We transact business in various foreign\\ncurrencies. In general, the functional currency of a foreign operation is the local country\\x92s currency. Consequently, revenues and expenses of operations outside the United States are translated into U.S. Dollars using weighted-average exchange\\nrates while assets and liabilities of operations outside the United States are translated into U.S. Dollars using exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The \\n \\xa0 88 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued) \\nMay 31, 2018  \\xa0\\n \\neffects of foreign currency translation adjustments are included in stockholders\\x92 equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated balance\\nsheets and related periodic movements are summarized as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Net foreign exchange transaction losses included in non-operating income, net in the\\naccompanying consolidated statements of operations were $74\\xa0million, $152\\xa0million and $110\\xa0million in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. \\nStock-Based Compensation  We account for share-based\\npayments to employees, including grants of service-based restricted stock awards, performance-based restricted stock awards (PSUs), service-based employee stock options, performance-based stock options (PSOs), and purchases under employee stock\\npurchase plans in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation\\x97Stock Compensation, which requires that share-based payments (to the extent they are compensatory) be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their\\nfair values. We account for forfeitures of stock-based awards as they occur.  For our service-based stock awards, we recognize stock-based\\ncompensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period of the award, which is generally four years.  For our PSUs and PSOs, we\\nrecognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the longer of the derived, explicit or implicit service period (which is the period of time expected for the performance condition to be satisfied). During our interim and\\nannual reporting periods, stock-based compensation expense is recorded based on expected attainment of performance targets. Changes in our estimates of the expected attainment of performance targets that result in a change in the number of shares\\nthat are expected to vest, or changes in our estimates of implicit service periods may cause the amount of stock-based compensation expense that we record for each interim reporting period to vary. Any changes in estimates that impact our\\nexpectation of the number of shares that are expected to vest are reflected in the amount of stock-based compensation expense that we recognize for each PSU or PSO tranche on a cumulative catch up basis during each interim reporting period in which\\nsuch estimates are altered. Changes in estimate of the implicit service period are recognized prospectively.  We record deferred tax assets for\\nstock-based compensation awards that result in deductions on certain of our income tax returns based on the amount of stock-based compensation recognized and the fair values attributable to the vested portion of stock awards assumed in connection\\nwith a business combination at the statutory tax rates in the jurisdictions that we are able to recognize such tax deductions. The impacts of the actual tax deductions for stock-based awards that are realized in these jurisdictions are generally\\nrecognized in the reporting period that a restricted stock-based award vests or a stock option is exercised with any shortfall/windfall relative to the deferred tax asset established recorded as a discrete detriment/benefit to our provision for\\nincome taxes in such period.  Advertising  All\\nadvertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses, which were included within sales and marketing expenses, were $138\\xa0million, $95\\xa0million and $68\\xa0million in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. \\nResearch and Development and Software Development Costs \\nAll research and development costs are expensed as incurred. \\nSoftware development costs required to be capitalized under ASC 985-20, Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased\\nor Marketed, and under ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software, were not material to our consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016. \\n \\xa0 89 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued) \\nMay 31, 2018  \\xa0\\n Acquisition Related and Other Expenses \\nAcquisition related and other expenses consist of personnel related costs and stock-based compensation for transitional and certain other employees,\\nintegration related professional services, and certain business combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended and certain other operating items, net. \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nYear Ended May\\xa031,\\n\\xa0\\n\\n (in millions)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2018\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2017\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2016\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Transitional and other employee related costs\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa048\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa041\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa045\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Stock-based compensation\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n1\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n35\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n3\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Professional fees and other, net\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n3\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n33\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n10\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Business combination adjustments, net\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\x97\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(6\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(16\\n)\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Total acquisition related and other expenses\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n52\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n103\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n42\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n Non-Operating Income, net \\nNon-operating income, net consists primarily of interest income, net foreign currency exchange gains (losses),\\nthe noncontrolling interests in the net profits of our majority-owned subsidiaries (primarily Oracle Financial Services Software Limited and Oracle Corporation Japan) and net other income (losses), including net realized gains and losses related to\\nall of our investments and net unrealized gains and losses related to the small portion of our investment portfolio that we classify as trading.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nYear Ended May\\xa031,\\n\\xa0\\n\\n (in millions)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2018\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2017\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2016\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Interest income\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa01,201\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0802\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0538\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Foreign currency losses, net\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(74\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(152\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(110\\n)\\xa0\\n\\n Noncontrolling interests in income\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(135\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(118\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(116\\n)\\xa0\\n\\n Other income (loss), net\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n245\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n73\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(7\\n)\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Total non-operating income, net\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n1,237\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n605\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n305\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n Income Taxes  We account\\nfor income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740). Deferred income taxes are recorded for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting\\npurposes and amounts recognized for income tax purposes. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. \\nA two-step approach is applied pursuant to ASC 740 in the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax\\npositions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit, including resolution of any\\nrelated appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions\\nin our provision for income taxes line of our consolidated statements of operations.

We currently expect that most of our operating lease commitments will be\\nsubject to the new standard and recognized as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets upon our adoption of Topic 842, which will increase our total assets\\nand total liabilities that we report relative to such amounts prior to adoption. \\n \\xa0 91 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued) \\nMay 31, 2018  \\xa0\\n Revenue Recognition:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.\\xa02014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Topic 606 and subsequent amendments to the initial guidance: ASU 2015-14,\\nASU\\xa02016-08, ASU 2016-10, ASU 2016-12, ASU 2016-20, ASU 2017-10, ASU 2017-13 and ASU 2017-14, (collectively, Topic 606), which is effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2019. Topic\\n606 supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. The core principle of Topic 606 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is\\nexpected to be received for those goods or services. Topic 606 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are\\nrequired under existing GAAP, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance\\nobligation, among others. Topic 606 also provides guidance on the recognition of costs related to obtaining customer contracts, which will result in additional costs that will be capitalized.\\xa0We will adopt the requirements of the new standard\\nas of June\\xa01, 2018, utilizing the full retrospective method of transition and will adjust our consolidated financial statements from amounts previously reported for the fiscal 2018 and 2017 periods. We do not believe there will be a material\\nimpact to our revenues or operating expenses upon adoption of Topic 606. We are continuing to evaluate the impact related to our pending adoption of Topic 606 and our preliminary assessments are subject to change. \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n2.\\n ACQUISITIONS \\nFiscal 2018 Acquisitions  Acquisition of Aconex\\nLimited  On March\\xa028, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Aconex Limited (Aconex), a provider of cloud-based collaboration software\\nfor construction projects. We have included the financial results of Aconex in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. These results were not individually material to our consolidated financial statements. The total\\npreliminary purchase price for Aconex was approximately $1.2\\xa0billion, which consisted of approximately $1.2\\xa0billion in cash and $1\\xa0million for the fair values of stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed. In connection\\nwith the Aconex acquisition, we have preliminarily recorded $32\\xa0million of net tangible assets and $368\\xa0million of identifiable intangible assets based on their estimated fair values, and $832\\xa0million of residual goodwill. Goodwill\\ngenerated from our acquisition of Aconex was primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise after the acquisition and is not expected to be tax deductible. \\nOther Fiscal 2018 Acquisitions \\nDuring fiscal 2018, we acquired certain other companies and purchased certain technology and development assets primarily to expand our products and\\nservices offerings. These acquisitions were not significant individually or in the aggregate.  Fiscal 2017 Acquisitions \\nAcquisition of NetSuite Inc., a Related Party \\nOn November\\xa07, 2016, we completed our acquisition of NetSuite Inc. (NetSuite), a provider of cloud-based enterprise resource planning (ERP)\\nsoftware and related applications and a related party to Oracle. We acquired NetSuite to, among other things, expand our cloud software as a service offerings with a complementary set of cloud ERP and related cloud software applications for\\ncustomers.

The total purchase price for NetSuite was approximately $9.1\\xa0billion, which consisted of\\napproximately $9.0\\xa0billion in cash and $78\\xa0million for the fair values of restricted stock-based awards and stock options assumed. In allocating the purchase price based on estimated fair values, we recorded approximately $6.7\\xa0billion\\nof goodwill, $3.2\\xa0billion of identifiable intangible assets and $763\\xa0million of net tangible liabilities. Goodwill generated from our acquisition of NetSuite was primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise after the acquisition\\nand was not tax deductible.  Other Fiscal 2017 Acquisitions \\nDuring fiscal 2017, we acquired certain companies and purchased certain technology and development assets primarily to expand our products and services\\nofferings. These acquisitions were not individually or in the aggregate significant. We have included the financial results of the acquired companies in our consolidated financial statements from their respective acquisition dates, and the results\\nfrom each of these companies were not individually material to our consolidated financial statements. In the aggregate, the total purchase price for these acquisitions was approximately $3.0\\xa0billion, which consisted of $3.0\\xa0billion in cash\\nand $13\\xa0million for the fair values of restricted stock-based awards and stock options assumed. Based on their estimated fair values, we recorded $243\\xa0million of net tangible assets and $948\\xa0million of identifiable intangible assets\\nand $1.8\\xa0billion of residual goodwill related to our fiscal 2017 acquisitions.  Fiscal 2016 Acquisitions \\nDuring fiscal 2016, we acquired certain companies and purchased certain technology and development assets primarily to expand our products and services\\nofferings. These acquisitions were not significant individually or in the aggregate.  Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information \\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information in the table below summarizes the combined results of operations for Oracle, NetSuite, Aconex and certain\\nother companies that we acquired since the beginning of fiscal 2017 that were considered relevant for the purposes of unaudited pro forma financial information disclosure as if the companies were combined as of the beginning of fiscal 2017. The\\nunaudited pro forma financial information for all periods presented included the business combination accounting effects resulting from these acquisitions, including amortization charges from acquired intangible assets (certain of which are\\npreliminary), stock-based compensation charges for unvested restricted stock-based awards and stock options assumed, if any, and the related tax effects as though the aforementioned companies were combined as of the beginning of fiscal 2017. The\\nunaudited pro forma financial information as presented below is for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the acquisitions had taken place at the beginning of\\nfiscal 2017.  The unaudited pro forma financial information for fiscal 2018 combined the historical results of Oracle for fiscal 2018 and the\\nhistorical results of Aconex for the twelve month period ended December\\xa031, 2017 (adjusted due to differences in reporting periods and considering the date we acquired Aconex) and certain other companies that we acquired since the beginning of\\nfiscal 2018 based upon their respective previous reporting periods and the dates these companies were acquired by us, and the effects of the pro forma adjustments listed above. \\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information for fiscal 2017 combined the historical results of Oracle for fiscal 2017, the historical results of\\nNetSuite for the six month period ended September\\xa030, 2016 (adjusted due to differences in reporting periods and considering the date we acquired NetSuite) and the historical results of \\n \\xa0 93 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued) \\nMay 31, 2018  \\xa0\\n \\nAconex and certain other companies that we acquired since the beginning of fiscal 2017 based upon their respective previous reporting periods and the dates these companies were acquired by us,\\nand the effects of the pro forma adjustments listed above.

Marketable securities consist of Tier-1 commercial paper debt securities, corporate debt securities and certain other securities. \\nThe amortized principal amounts of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities approximated their fair values at May\\xa031, 2018 and 2017.\\nWe use the specific identification method to determine any realized gains or losses from the sale of our marketable securities classified as available-for-sale. Such\\nrealized gains and losses were insignificant for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016.

Our investment portfolio is subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. As described above, we limit purchases of marketable debt securities to\\ninvestment-grade securities, which have high credit ratings and also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. As stated in our investment policy, we are averse to principal loss and seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting\\ndefault risk and market risk.  Restricted cash that was included within cash and cash equivalents as presented within our consolidated balance\\nsheets as of May\\xa031, 2018 and 2017 and our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended May\\xa031, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was nominal.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n4.\\n FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS \\nWe perform fair value measurements in accordance with ASC 820. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or\\npaid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at their fair values, we consider the\\nprincipal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the assets or liabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance. \\n \\xa0 94 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued) \\nMay 31, 2018  \\xa0\\n ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable\\ninputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. An asset\\x92s or a liability\\x92s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value\\nmeasurement. ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Level\\xa01: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Level\\xa02: inputs other than Level\\xa01 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices\\nin active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially\\nthe full term of the assets or liabilities; or  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Level\\xa03: unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the\\nfair values of the assets or liabilities.

economic effects of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with the 2.375% senior notes due January 2019 (January 2019 Notes), the 2.25% senior notes due October 2019 (October 2019 Notes), the 2.80% senior notes due July 2021\\n(July 2021 Notes), and the 6.50% senior notes due April 2038 (April 2038 Notes) so that the interest payable on these notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. The effective interest rates after consideration of these fixed to variable\\ninterest rate swap agreements were 3.00% and 1.81%, respectively, for the January 2019 Notes, 2.81% and 1.64%, respectively, for the October 2019 Notes, and 2.96% and 1.79%, respectively, for the July 2021 Notes as of May\\xa031, 2018 and 2017,\\nrespectively. The effective interest rate as of May\\xa031, 2018 after consideration of the fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements was 5.65% for the April 2038 Notes. Refer to Notes 1 and 10 for a description of our accounting for fair\\nvalue hedges.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n(2)\\n In July 2013, we issued\\n\\x802.0\\xa0billion of fixed-rate senior notes comprised of \\x801.25\\xa0billion of 2.25% senior notes due January 2021 (January 2021 Notes) and \\x80750\\xa0million of 3.125% senior notes due July 2025 (July 2025 Notes, and together with the January 2021 Notes, the Euro Notes). Principal and unamortized discount/issuance costs for the Euro Notes\\nin the table above were calculated using foreign currency exchange rates as of May\\xa031, 2018 and May\\xa031, 2017, respectively. The Euro Notes are registered and trade on the New York Stock Exchange. \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n(3)\\n In connection with the issuance of the January 2021 Notes,\\nwe entered into certain cross-currency swap agreements that have the economic effect of converting our fixed-rate, Euro-denominated debt, including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate, U.S.\\nDollar-denominated debt of $1.6\\xa0billion with a fixed annual interest rate of 3.53% (see Note 10 for additional information).  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n(4)\\n We designated the July 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge\\nof our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholders\\x92 equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with\\nrespect to the U.S.\\xa0Dollar in connection with the issuance of the July 2025 Notes. In our fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 we de-designated the 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge and entered into certain\\ncross-currency interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of converting our fixed-rate, Euro-denominated debt, including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a variable-rate, U.S. Dollar-denominated\\ndebt of $0.9\\xa0billion based on LIBOR. The effective interest rate as of May\\xa031, 2018 after consideration of the cross-currency interest rate swap agreements was 5.17% for the July 2025 Notes. Refer to Notes 1 and 10 for a description of our\\naccounting for fair value hedges.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n(5)\\n In July 2016, we issued $14.0\\xa0billion of senior notes\\nfor general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and repayment of indebtedness and future acquisitions. The interest is payable semi-annually. We may redeem some or all of the senior\\nnotes of each series prior to their maturity, subject to certain restrictions, and the payment of an applicable make-whole premium in certain instances.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n(6)\\n In November 2017, we issued $10.0\\xa0billion of senior\\nnotes for general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and repayment of indebtedness and future acquisitions. The interest is payable semi-annually. We may redeem some or all of the\\nsenior notes of each series prior to their maturity, subject to certain restrictions, and the payment of an applicable make-whole premium in certain instances. \\nFuture principal payments (adjusted for the effects of the cross-currency swap agreements associated with the January 2021 Notes and July 2025 Notes)\\nfor all of our borrowings at May\\xa031, 2018 were as follows (in millions):  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Fiscal 2019\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n4,500\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Fiscal 2020\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n4,500\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Fiscal 2021\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2,446\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Fiscal 2022\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n8,250\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Fiscal 2023\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n3,750\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Thereafter\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n37,481\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Total\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa060,927\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n Senior Notes  Interest is\\npayable semi-annually for the senior notes listed in the above table except for the Euro Notes for which interest is payable annually and the floating-rate senior notes for which interest is payable quarterly.

All existing and future liabilities of the subsidiaries of Oracle\\nCorporation are or will be effectively senior to the senior notes and any future issuances of commercial paper notes. We were in compliance with all debt-related covenants at May\\xa031, 2018. \\nRevolving Credit Agreements  In May 2018, we entered into\\nthree revolving credit agreements with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as initial lender and administrative agent (the 2018 Credit Agreements) and borrowed $2.5\\xa0billion pursuant to these agreements. The 2018 Credit Agreements provided us with\\nshort-term borrowings for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Interest for the 2018 Credit Agreements is based on either (1)\\xa0a LIBOR-based formula or (2)\\xa0the Base Rate formula, as set forth in the 2018 Credit Agreements.\\nThe borrowings are due and payable on June\\xa028, 2018, which is the termination date of the 2018 Credit Agreements.  In May 2017, we borrowed\\n$3.8\\xa0billion pursuant to four revolving credit agreements with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as initial lender and administrative agent (the 2017 Credit Agreements). In June 2017, we repaid the $3.8\\xa0billion and the 2017 Credit Agreements\\nexpired pursuant to their terms.  In May 2016, we borrowed $3.8\\xa0billion pursuant to three revolving credit agreements with JPMorgan Chase\\nBank, N.A., as initial lender and administrative agent (the 2016 Credit Agreements). In June 2016, we repaid the $3.8\\xa0billion and the 2016 Credit Agreements expired pursuant to their terms. \\nIn April 2013, we entered into a $3.0\\xa0billion Revolving Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Bank of America, N.A., BNP Paribas, JPMorgan\\nChase Bank, N.A. and certain other lenders (the 2013 Credit Agreement). The 2013 Credit Agreement provided for an unsecured 5-year revolving credit facility to be used for general corporate purposes including\\nback-stopping any commercial paper notes that we may issue. In April 2018, the 2013 Credit Agreement expired. No amounts were outstanding as of the expiration date nor as of May\\xa031, 2017. \\nCommercial Paper Program and Commercial Paper Notes  In\\nApril 2013, pursuant to our existing $3.0\\xa0billion commercial paper program which allows us to issue and sell unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a private placement exemption from the registration requirements under federal and\\nstate securities laws, we entered into new dealer agreements with various banks and a new Issuing and Paying Agency Agreement with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A\\xa0(JP Morgan). Effective on December\\xa022, 2014, Deutsche Bank Trust Companies\\nAmericas became the Successor Issuing and Paying Agent replacing JP Morgan.\\xa0Since that time, we have entered into new dealer agreements with additional banks. As of May\\xa031, 2018 and 2017, we did not have any outstanding commercial paper\\nnotes.  Other Borrowings Activities  In connection\\nwith our acquisition of NetSuite in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 (see Note 2 above), we assumed $310\\xa0million par value of legacy NetSuite convertible notes (NetSuite Debt), which had a fair value of $342\\xa0million as of the acquisition\\ndate. In December 2016, we repurchased and settled for cash substantially all of the NetSuite Debt.  In the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we\\nassumed $113\\xa0million of debt that bears interest at 3.53% and matures in August 2025 in connection with our acquisition of certain land and buildings.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n8.\\n RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES \\nFiscal 2017 Oracle Restructuring Plan  During the first\\nquarter of fiscal 2017, our management approved, committed to and initiated plans to restructure and further improve efficiencies in our operations due to our recent acquisitions and certain other \\n \\xa0 100 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued) \\nMay 31, 2018  \\xa0\\n \\noperational activities (2017 Restructuring Plan).

We generally have estimated the fair values of these obligations assumed using a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up\\napproach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. The sum of the costs and operating profit approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to\\nassume these acquired obligations. These aforementioned fair value adjustments recorded for obligations assumed from our acquisitions reduced the cloud services and license support and hardware deferred revenues balances that we recorded as\\nliabilities from these acquisitions and also reduced the resulting revenues that we recognized or will recognize over the terms of the acquired obligations during the post-combination periods. \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n10.\\n DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\nFair Value Hedges\\x97Interest Rate Swap Agreements and Cross-Currency Interest Rate Swap Agreements \\nIn May 2018, we entered into certain cross-currency interest rate swap agreements to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our\\nJuly 2025 Notes by effectively converting the fixed-rate, Euro denominated 2025 Notes, including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to variable-rate, U.S.\\xa0Dollar denominated debt based on LIBOR. In April\\n2018, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with our April 2038 Notes so that the interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable\\nbased on LIBOR. In July 2014, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with our October 2019 Notes and our July 2021 Notes so that the interest payable\\non these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. In July 2013, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with our January 2019 Notes so\\nthat the interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. The critical terms of the swap agreements match the critical terms of the July 2025 Notes, April 2038 Notes, October 2019 Notes, July 2021 Notes and the\\nJanuary 2019 Notes that the swap agreements pertain to, including the notional amounts and maturity dates.  We have designated the aforementioned\\nswap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for them as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815. These transactions are characterized as fair value hedges for financial accounting purposes because they protect us against\\nchanges in the fair values of certain of our fixed-rate borrowings due to benchmark interest rate movements. The changes in fair values of these swap agreements are recognized as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations with the\\ncorresponding amounts included in other assets or other non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of net gain (loss) attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized as interest\\nexpense in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amount included in notes payable, non-current. The periodic interest settlements for the swap agreements for the July 2025 Notes,\\nApril 2038 Notes, October 2019 Notes, July 2021 Notes and the January 2019 Notes are recorded as interest expense and are included as a part of cash flows from operating activities. \\nWe do not use any swap agreements for trading purposes.  Cash\\nFlow Hedges\\x97Cross-Currency Swap Agreements  In connection with the issuance of the January 2021 Notes, we entered into certain\\ncross-currency swap agreements to manage the related foreign currency exchange risk by effectively converting the fixed-rate, Euro-denominated January 2021 Notes, including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at\\n\\n \\xa0 103 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued) \\nMay 31, 2018  \\xa0\\n \\nmaturity, to fixed-rate, U.S. Dollar-denominated debt. The economic effect of the swap agreements was to eliminate the uncertainty of the cash flows in U.S. Dollars associated with the January\\n2021 Notes by fixing the principal amount of the January 2021 Notes at $1.6\\xa0billion with a fixed annual interest rate of 3.53%. We have designated these cross-currency swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for\\nthese as cash flow hedges pursuant to ASC 815. The critical terms of the cross-currency swap agreements correspond to the January 2021 Notes including the annual interest payments being hedged, and the cross-currency swap agreements mature at the\\nsame time as the January 2021 Notes.  We used the hypothetical derivative method to measure the effectiveness of our cross-currency swap\\nagreements. The fair values of these cross-currency swap agreements are recognized as other assets or other non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The effective portions of the changes in\\nfair values of these cross-currency swap agreements are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets and an amount is reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss into\\nnon-operating income, net in the same period that the carrying values of the Euro-denominated January 2021 Notes are remeasured and the interest expense is recognized. The ineffective portion of the unrealized\\ngains and losses on these cross-currency swaps, if any, are recorded immediately to non-operating income, net. We evaluate the effectiveness of our cross-currency swap agreements on a quarterly basis. We did\\nnot record any ineffectiveness for fiscal 2018, 2017 or 2016. The cash flows related to the cross-currency swap agreements that pertain to the periodic interest settlements are classified as operating activities and the cash flows that pertain to\\nthe principal balance are classified as financing activities.  We do not use any cross-currency swap agreements for trading purposes. \\nNet Investment Hedge\\x97Foreign Currency Borrowings \\nIn July 2013, we designated our July 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the\\nEuro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholders\\x92 equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the U.S.\\xa0Dollar. We used the spot method to measure the\\neffectiveness of our net investment hedge. Under this method, for each reporting period, the change in the carrying value of the Euro-denominated July 2025 Notes due to remeasurement of the effective portion is reported in accumulated other\\ncomprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet and the remaining change in the carrying value of the ineffective portion, if any, was recognized in non-operating income, net in our consolidated\\nstatements of operations. We evaluated the effectiveness of our net investment hedge at the beginning of every quarter. We did not record any ineffectiveness for fiscal 2018, 2017 or 2016. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we de-designated the July 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge, and as noted above, we entered into cross-currency interest rate swap agreements to manage the foreign currency exchange risk associated with our July\\n2025 Notes by effectively converting the fixed-rate, Euro denominated debt, including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to variable-rate, U.S.\\xa0Dollar denominated debt. \\nForeign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as Hedges \\nWe transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset\\nthe risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or\\nlosses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions. We may suspend this program from time to time. Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from\\nintercompany sublicense fees, intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions that are generally expected to be cash settled in the near term. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. Our ultimate realized\\ngain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of \\n \\xa0 104 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued) \\nMay 31, 2018  \\xa0\\n \\ncross-currency exposures that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized and unrealized gains or losses on foreign\\ncurrency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors.  Neither do we use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading\\npurposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815. Accordingly, we recorded the fair values of these contracts as of the end of each reporting period to our consolidated balance sheets with changes in\\nfair values recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. The balance sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is prepaid expenses and other current assets for forward contracts in an unrealized gain position and\\nother current liabilities for forward contracts in an unrealized loss position. The statement of operations classification for changes in fair values of these forward contracts is non-operating income, net,\\nfor both realized and unrealized gains and losses.  The notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase U.S. Dollars in exchange for\\nother major international currencies was $3.4\\xa0billion as of each of May\\xa031, 2018 and 2017 and the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies was $1.4\\xa0billion\\nas of each of May\\xa031, 2018 and 2017. The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal at May\\xa031, 2018 and 2017. The cash flows related to these foreign currency contracts are classified as operating\\nactivities. Net gains or losses related to these forward contracts are included in non-operating income, net. \\nThe effects of derivative and non-derivative instruments designated as hedges on certain of our

We have approximately $61\\xa0million in facility obligations, net of estimated sublease income and other costs, in accrued restructuring for these locations in our\\nconsolidated balance sheet at May\\xa031, 2018.  Rent expense was $292\\xa0million, $273\\xa0million and $283\\xa0million for fiscal 2018, 2017\\nand 2016, respectively, net of sublease income of approximately $104\\xa0million, $87\\xa0million and $45\\xa0million for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Certain lease agreements contain renewal options providing for extensions of the\\nlease terms.  Unconditional Obligations  In the\\nordinary course of business, we enter into certain unconditional purchase obligations with our suppliers, which are agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and specify terms, including: fixed or minimum\\n\\n \\xa0 106 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued) \\nMay 31, 2018  \\xa0\\n \\nquantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payment. We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for our hardware products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished hardware products. We also obtain individual components for our hardware products from a variety of individual suppliers\\nbased on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead-times and/or commercially standard lead-times for the\\nparticular part or product and have been included in the amounts below. Routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to our external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in the ordinary\\ncourse of business are not included in the amounts below, as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way. \\nAs of May\\xa031, 2018, our unconditional purchase and certain other obligations were as follows (in millions): \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Fiscal 2019\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n757\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Fiscal 2020\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n291\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Fiscal 2021\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n189\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Fiscal 2022\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n114\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Fiscal 2023\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n24\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Total\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa01,375\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n As described in Notes 7 and 10 above, as of May\\xa031, 2018 we have senior notes and other borrowings of\\n$60.9\\xa0billion that mature at various future dates and derivative financial instruments outstanding that we leverage to manage certain risks and exposures. \\nGuarantees  Our cloud, license and hardware sales\\nagreements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if our products infringe a third party\\x92s intellectual property rights. To date, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such\\nindemnifications and have not accrued any material liabilities related to such obligations in our consolidated financial statements. Certain of our sales agreements also include provisions indemnifying customers against liabilities in the event we\\nbreach confidentiality or service level requirements. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to our limited and infrequent history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts\\nand circumstances involved in each particular agreement.  Our Oracle Cloud Services agreements generally include a warranty that the cloud services\\nwill be performed in all material respects as defined in the agreement during the service period. Our license and hardware agreements also generally include a warranty that our products will substantially operate as described in the applicable\\nprogram documentation for a period of one year after delivery. We also warrant that services we perform will be provided in a manner consistent with industry standards for a period of 90 days from performance of the services. \\nWe occasionally are required, for various reasons, to enter into\\xa0financial guarantees with third parties in\\xa0the ordinary course of our\\nbusiness\\xa0including, among others,\\xa0guarantees related to taxes, import licenses and letters of credit on behalf of parties with whom we conduct business. Such agreements have not had a material effect on our results of operations, financial\\nposition or cash flows. \\n \\xa0 107 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued) \\nMay 31, 2018  \\xa0\\n In connection with certain litigation, we posted certain court-mandated surety bonds with a court and\\nentered into related indemnification agreements with each of the surety bond issuing companies.

During fiscal 2018, our Board of Directors approved expansions of our stock repurchase program totaling $24.0\\xa0billion. As of May\\xa031, 2018, approximately $17.8\\xa0billion\\nremained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 238.0\\xa0million shares for $11.5\\xa0billion (including 3.8\\xa0million shares for $180\\xa0million that were repurchased but not settled),\\n85.6\\xa0million shares for $3.5\\xa0billion and 271.9\\xa0million shares for $10.4\\xa0billion in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, under the stock repurchase program. \\nOur stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working\\ncapital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time\\nthrough open market purchases and pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time. \\nDividends on Common Stock  During fiscal 2018, 2017 and\\n2016, our Board of Directors declared cash dividends of $0.76, $0.64 and $0.60 per share of our outstanding common stock, respectively, which we paid during the same period. \\nIn June 2018, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share of our outstanding common stock. The dividend is payable on\\nJuly\\xa031, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July\\xa017, 2018. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of\\nDirectors.

Under the terms of the 2000 Plan, long-term full value awards are granted in the form of restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance stock units (PSUs). For\\neach share granted as a full value award under the 2000 Plan, an equivalent of 2.5 shares is deducted from our pool of shares available for grant.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n In fiscal 2018, our stockholders, upon the recommendation of the Board, approved a further increase in the number of\\nauthorized shares of stock that may be issued under the 2000 Plan by 330,000,000 shares, and approved material terms of the performance goals under which PSUs and performance-based stock options (PSOs) could be granted. \\nAs of May\\xa031, 2018, the 2000 Plan had 83\\xa0million unvested RSUs outstanding, 3\\xa0million unvested PSUs outstanding, 69\\xa0million PSOs\\noutstanding and service-based stock options (SOs) to purchase 231\\xa0million shares of common stock outstanding of which 197\\xa0million shares were vested. As of May\\xa031, 2018, approximately 376\\xa0million shares of common stock were\\navailable for future awards under the 2000 Plan. To date, we have not issued any stock purchase rights or stock appreciation rights under the 2000 Plan. \\nThe vesting schedule for all awards grated under the 2000 Plan are established by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. RSUs generally\\nrequire vesting 25% annually over four years. The vesting schedule for PSUs currently requires achieving performance targets and providing service over four fiscal years. SOs are granted at not less than fair market value, become exercisable\\ngenerally 25% annually over four years under our current practice, and generally expire 10 years from the date of grant. PSOs granted to four of our executive officers in fiscal 2018 consist of seven numerically equivalent vesting tranches that\\npotentially may vest. One tranche vests solely on attainment of a market-based metric. The remaining six tranches require the attainment of both a performance metric and a market capitalization metric. In each case, the market-based metric,\\nperformance metrics and market capitalization metrics may be achieved at any time during a five year performance period, assuming continued employment and service through the date the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors certifies that\\nperformance has been achieved. The PSOs have contractual lives of eight years in comparison to the typical ten year contractual lives for SOs. For the six tranches of the PSOs with both performance and market conditions, stock-based compensation\\nexpense is to be recognized once each vesting tranche becomes probable of achievement over the longer of the estimated implicit service period or derived service. We have preliminarily estimated service periods for those tranches that have been\\ndeemed probable of achievement to be approximately three to five years. Stock-based compensation for the market-based tranche will be recognized using the derived service period for the market-based metric achievement, which we have initially\\nestimated to be approximately three years. \\n \\xa0 109 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued) \\nMay 31, 2018  \\xa0\\n In fiscal 1993, the Board adopted the 1993 Directors\\x92 Stock Plan (the Directors\\x92 Plan),\\nwhich provides for the issuance of RSUs and other stock-based awards, including non-qualified stock options, to non-employee directors. The Directors\\x92 Plan has from\\ntime to time been amended and restated. Under the terms of the Directors\\x92 Plan, 10\\xa0million shares of common stock are reserved for issuance (including a fiscal 2013 amendment to increase the number of shares of our common stock reserved\\nfor issuance by 2\\xa0million shares). In prior years, we granted stock options at not less than fair market value, that vest over four years, and expire no more than 10 years from the date of grant. The Directors\\x92 Plan was most recently\\namended on April\\xa029, 2016 and permits the Compensation Committee of the Board to determine the amount and form of automatic grants of stock awards to each non-employee director upon first becoming a\\ndirector and thereafter on an annual basis, as well as automatic nondiscretionary grants for chairing certain Board committees, subject to certain stockholder approved limitations set forth in the Directors\\x92 Plan. As of May\\xa031, 2018,\\napproximately 109,000 unvested RSUs and stock options to purchase approximately 1\\xa0million shares of common stock (of which approximately 1\\xa0million were vested) were outstanding under the Directors\\x92 Plan. As of May\\xa031, 2018,\\napproximately 1\\xa0million shares were available for future stock awards under this plan.  In connection with certain of our acquisitions, we\\nassumed certain outstanding restricted stock-based awards and stock options under each acquired company\\x92s respective stock plans, or we substituted substantially similar awards under the 2000 Plan. These restricted stock-based awards and stock\\noptions assumed or substituted generally retain all of the rights, terms and conditions of the respective plans under which they were originally granted. As of May\\xa031, 2018, approximately 3\\xa0million shares of restricted stock-based awards\\nand stock options to purchase 3\\xa0million shares of common stock were outstanding under these plans.  The following table summarizes restricted\\nstock-based award activity, including service based awards and performance-based awards, granted pursuant to Oracle-based stock plans and stock plans assumed from our acquisitions for our last three fiscal years ended May\\xa031, 2018: \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nRestricted\\xa0Stock-Based\\xa0Awards\\xa0Outstanding\\n\\xa0\\n\\n (in millions, except fair value)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0Number\\xa0of\\xa0\\xa0Shares\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nWeighted-Average\\xa0\\xa0Grant\\xa0Date\\xa0Fair\\xa0\\nValue\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Balance, May\\xa031, 2015\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa028\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n40.63\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Granted\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n34\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n38.50\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Vested and Issued\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(7\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n40.39\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Canceled\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(3\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n39.73\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Balance, May\\xa031, 2016\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n52\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n39.29\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Granted\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n42\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n39.40\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Assumed\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n14\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n37.83\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Vested and Issued\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(18\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n40.39\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Canceled\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(7\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n39.73\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Balance, May\\xa031, 2017\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n83\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n39.18\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Granted\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n44\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n47.42\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Vested and Issued\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(27\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n39.10\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Canceled\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(11\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n41.97\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Balance, May\\xa031, 2018\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n89\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n42.93\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n The total grant date fair value of restricted stock-based awards that were vested and issued in fiscal 2018, 2017 and\\n2016 was $1.0\\xa0billion, $715\\xa0million and $261\\xa0million, respectively.

The vesting conditions and related terms of our PSUs were communicated to each participating employee as of their respective grant dates and included attainment metrics that were\\ndefined, fixed and based upon consistent U.S. GAAP metrics or internal metrics that are defined, fixed and consistently determined, and that require the employee to render service. Therefore, these awards met the performance-based award\\nclassification criteria as defined within ASC 718.  We estimated the fair values of our stock options that were solely subject to service-based\\nvesting requirements using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, which was developed for use in estimating the fair values of stock options. Option valuation models, including the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, require the input\\nof assumptions, including stock price volatility. Changes in the input assumptions can affect the fair value estimates and ultimately how much we recognize as stock-based compensation expense. The fair values of our stock options were estimated at\\nthe grant dates or at the acquisition dates for options assumed in a business combination. The weighted-average input assumptions used and resulting fair values of our stock options were as follows for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016: \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nYear Ended May\\xa031,\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02018\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02017\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02016\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Expected life (in years)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n4.7\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n4.8\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n4.8\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Risk-free interest rate\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2.0%\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n1.0%\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n1.6%\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Volatility\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n22%\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n23%\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n24%\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Dividend yield\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n1.5%\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n1.5%\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n1.5%\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Weighted-average fair value per share\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n9.34\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n8.18\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n8.49\\n\\xa0\\n The expected life input is based on historical exercise patterns and post-vesting termination behavior, the risk-free\\ninterest rate input is based on U.S. Treasury instruments, the annualized dividend yield input is based on the per share dividend declared by the Board and the volatility input is calculated based on the implied volatility of our publicly traded\\noptions.

The total aggregate intrinsic value of restricted stock-based awards that vested and were issued and stock options that were exercised was $3.0\\xa0billion, $2.0\\xa0billion and $1.0\\xa0billion for fiscal 2018, 2017 and\\n2016, respectively. In connection with the vesting and issuance of restricted stock-based awards and stock options that were exercised, the tax benefits realized by us were $860\\xa0million, $614\\xa0million and $311\\xa0million for fiscal 2018,\\n2017 and 2016, respectively.  Employee Stock Purchase Plan \\nWe have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (Purchase Plan) that allows employees to purchase shares of common stock at a price per share that is 95% of\\nthe fair market value of Oracle stock as of the end of the semi-annual option period. As of May\\xa031, 2018, 48\\xa0million shares were reserved for future issuances under the Purchase Plan. We issued 3\\xa0million shares in each of fiscal 2018,\\n2017 and 2016, respectively, under the Purchase Plan.  Defined Contribution and Other Postretirement Plans \\nWe offer various defined contribution plans for our U.S. and non-U.S. employees. Total defined contribution\\nplan expense was $384\\xa0million, $366\\xa0million and $387\\xa0million for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The number of plan participants in our benefit plans has generally increased in recent years as we have hired additional\\nemployees and assumed eligible employees from our acquisitions.  In the United States, regular employees can participate in the Oracle Corporation\\n401(k) Savings and Investment Plan (Oracle 401(k) Plan). Participants can generally contribute up to 40% of their eligible compensation on a per-pay-period basis as\\ndefined by the Oracle 401(k) Plan document or by the section 402(g) limit as defined by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). We match a portion of employee contributions, currently 50% up to 6% of compensation each pay period, subject to maximum\\naggregate matching amounts. Our contributions to the Oracle 401(k) Plan, net of forfeitures, were $151\\xa0million, $157\\xa0million and $153\\xa0million in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. \\nWe also offer non-qualified deferred compensation plans to certain employees whereby they may defer a portion\\nof their annual base and/or variable compensation until retirement or a date specified by the employee in accordance with the plans. Deferred compensation plan assets and liabilities were each approximately $555\\xa0million as of May\\xa031, 2018\\nand were each approximately $487\\xa0million as of May\\xa031, 2017 and were presented in other assets and other non-current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. \\nWe sponsor certain defined benefit pension plans that are offered primarily by certain of our foreign subsidiaries. Many of these plans were assumed\\nthrough our acquisitions or are required by local regulatory requirements. We may deposit funds for these plans with insurance companies, third-party trustees, or into government-managed accounts consistent with local regulatory requirements, as\\napplicable. Our total defined benefit plan pension expenses were $102\\xa0million, $85\\xa0million and $95\\xa0million for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The aggregate projected benefit obligation and aggregate net liability (funded\\nstatus) of our defined benefit plans as of May\\xa031, 2018 was $1.1\\xa0billion and $711\\xa0million, respectively, and as of May\\xa031, 2017 was $1.1\\xa0billion and $712\\xa0million, respectively. \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n14.\\n INCOME TAXES \\nOur effective tax rates for each of the periods presented are the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad\\nrange of income tax rates. In the third quarter of fiscal 2018 the Tax Act was signed into law. The more significant provisions of the Tax Act as applicable to us are described in Note 1 above under \\x93Impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of\\n2017\\x94. Our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2018 varied from the 21% U.S. statutory rate imposed by the Tax Act due primarily to the January\\xa01, 2018 effective date of \\n \\xa0 113 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued) \\nMay 31, 2018  \\xa0\\n \\nthe Tax Act, the impacts of the Tax Act upon adoption, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with tax authorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation and\\nthe U.S. domestic production activity deduction. Prior to the January\\xa01, 2018 effective date of the Tax Act, our provision for income taxes historically differed from the tax computed at the previous U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due\\nprimarily to certain earnings considered as indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with tax authorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation and the U.S. domestic\\nproduction activity deduction.

If the other outside basis differences were recognized in a taxable transaction, they would generate foreign tax credits that would reduce the federal tax liability associated with the foreign dividend or the\\notherwise taxable transaction. At May\\xa031, 2018, assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits, the potential net deferred tax liability associated with these other outside basis temporary differences would be approximately\\n$1.5\\xa0billion.  Our net deferred tax assets were $1.4\\xa0billion and $683\\xa0million as of May\\xa031, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We\\nbelieve that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generation of sufficient taxable income in future years in\\nappropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future\\nperiods if estimates of future taxable income change.  The valuation allowance was $1.3\\xa0billion and $1.2\\xa0billion at each of May\\xa031,\\n2018 and 2017, respectively. Substantially all of the valuation allowances as of May\\xa031, 2018 and 2017 related to tax assets established in purchase accounting. Any subsequent reduction of that portion of the valuation allowance and the\\nrecognition of the associated tax benefits associated with our acquisitions will be recorded to our provision for income taxes subsequent to our final determination of the valuation allowance or the conclusion of the measurement period (as defined\\nabove), whichever comes first.  At May\\xa031, 2018, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $806\\xa0million, which are\\nsubject to limitation on their utilization. Approximately $802\\xa0million of these federal net operating losses expire in various years between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2036. An immaterial amount of these federal net operating losses are not\\ncurrently subject to expiration dates. We had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $2.4\\xa0billion at May\\xa031, 2018, which expire between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2036 and are subject to limitations on their utilization. We\\nhad total foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1.8\\xa0billion at May\\xa031, 2018, which are subject to limitations on their utilization. Approximately $1.8\\xa0billion of these foreign net operating losses are not\\ncurrently subject to expiration dates. The remainder of the foreign net operating losses, approximately $92\\xa0million, expire between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2035. We had tax credit carryforwards of approximately $893\\xa0million at May\\xa031,\\n2018, which are subject to limitations on their utilization. Approximately $738\\xa0million of these tax credit carryforwards are not currently subject to expiration dates. The remainder of the tax credit carryforwards, approximately\\n$155\\xa0million, expire in various years between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2038.  We classify our unrecognized tax benefits as either current or non-current income taxes payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

We recognized interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our provision for income taxes line of our consolidated statements of operations\\nof $127\\xa0million, $125\\xa0million and $26\\xa0million during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Interest and penalties accrued as of May\\xa031, 2018 and 2017 were $992\\xa0million and $885\\xa0million, respectively. \\nDomestically, U.S. federal and state taxing authorities are currently examining income tax returns of Oracle and various acquired entities for years\\nthrough fiscal 2017. Many issues are at an advanced stage in the examination process, the most significant of which include the deductibility of certain royalty payments, transfer pricing, extraterritorial income exemptions, domestic production\\nactivity, foreign tax credits, and research and development credits taken. With all of these domestic audit issues considered in the aggregate, we believe that it was reasonably possible that, as of May\\xa031, 2018, the gross unrecognized tax\\nbenefits related to these audits could decrease (whether by payment, release, or a combination of both) in the next 12 months by as much as $665\\xa0million ($611\\xa0million net of offsetting tax benefits). Our U.S. federal income tax returns\\nhave been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2007 and we are no longer subject to audit for those periods. Our U.S. state income tax returns, with some exceptions, have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2004, and we are no longer\\nsubject to audit for those periods.  Internationally, tax authorities for numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions\\nare also examining returns affecting our unrecognized tax benefits. We believe that it was reasonably possible that, as of May\\xa031, 2018, the gross unrecognized tax benefits, could decrease (whether by payment, release, or a combination of both)\\nby as much as $162\\xa0million ($68\\xa0million net of offsetting tax benefits) in the next 12 months, related primarily to transfer pricing. With some exceptions, we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations in non-U.S. jurisdictions for years prior to fiscal 1997.  We believe that we have adequately provided under GAAP\\nfor outcomes related to our tax audits. However, there can be no assurances as to the possible outcomes or any related financial statement effect thereof. On July\\xa027, 2015, in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner, the U.S. Tax Court issued an\\nopinion related to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement. At this time, the U.S. Department of the Treasury has not withdrawn the requirement to include stock-based compensation from its\\nregulations. We have reviewed this case and its impact on Oracle and concluded that no adjustment to the consolidated financial statements is appropriate at this time. We will continue to monitor ongoing developments and potential impacts to our\\nconsolidated financial statements.  We are under audit by the IRS and various other domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to income tax\\nand indirect tax matters and are involved in various challenges and litigation in a number of countries, including, in particular, Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Indonesia, Korea, Mexico, Spain and the United Kingdom, where the amounts under\\ncontroversy are significant. In some, although not all cases, we have reserved for potential adjustments to our provision for income taxes and accrual of indirect taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these\\ntax authorities or final outcomes in judicial proceedings, and we believe that the final outcome of these examinations, agreements or judicial proceedings will not have a material effect on our results of operations. If events occur which indicate\\npayment of these amounts is unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in the recognition of benefits in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimates of the federal, state, and foreign income tax\\nliabilities and indirect tax liabilities are less than the ultimate assessment, it could result in a further charge to expense.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n15.\\n SEGMENT INFORMATION \\nASC 280, Segment Reporting, establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments.

Our chief operating\\ndecision makers (CODMs) are our Chief Executive Officers and Chief Technology Officer. We are organized by line of business and geographically. While our CODMs evaluate results in a number of different ways, the line of business management structure\\nis the primary basis for which the allocation of resources and financial results are assessed. The footnote information below presents the financial information provided to our CODMs for their review and assists our CODMs with evaluating the\\ncompany\\x92s performance and allocating company resources.  We have three businesses\\x97cloud and license, hardware and services\\x97each of\\nwhich are comprised of a single operating segment.  Our cloud and license business engages in the sale, marketing and delivery of our applications,\\nplatform and infrastructure technologies through various deployment models including license support offerings; Oracle Cloud Services offerings; and cloud license and on-premise license offerings. License\\nsupport revenues are typically generated through the sale of license support contracts related to cloud license and on-premise licenses purchased by our customers at their option and are generally recognized\\nas revenues ratably over the contractual term. Our Oracle Cloud Services offerings deliver certain of our applications, platform and infrastructure technologies on a subscription basis via cloud-based deployment models that we host, manage and\\nsupport and revenues generally are recognized over the subscription period. Cloud license and on-premise license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses, generally on a perpetual basis,\\nto use our database and middleware and our applications software products within cloud and on-premise IT environments and are generally recognized as revenues when unrestricted access to the license is\\ngranted, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met.  Our hardware business provides Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage,\\nindustry-specific hardware, operating systems, virtualization, management and other hardware-related software to support diverse IT environments.

The complaint alleged that when Oracle announced on March\\xa022 and\\n23, 2011 that it would no longer develop future versions of its software to run on HP\\x92s Itanium-based servers, it breached a settlement agreement signed on September\\xa020, 2010 between HP and Mark Hurd (the Hurd Settlement Agreement), who is\\nour Chief Executive Officer and was both HP\\x92s former chief executive officer and chairman of HP\\x92s board of directors. HP sought a judicial declaration of the parties\\x92 rights and obligations under the Hurd Settlement Agreement and\\nother equitable and monetary relief.  Oracle answered the complaint and filed a cross-complaint, which was amended on December\\xa02, 2011. The\\namended cross-complaint alleged claims including violation of the Lanham Act. Oracle alleged that HP had secretly agreed to pay Intel to continue to develop and manufacture the Itanium microprocessor, and had misrepresented to customers that the\\nItanium microprocessor had a long roadmap, among other claims. Oracle sought equitable rescission of the Hurd Settlement Agreement, and other equitable and monetary relief. \\nThe court bifurcated the trial and tried HP\\x92s causes of action for declaratory relief and promissory estoppel without a jury in June 2012. The\\ncourt issued a final statement of decision on August\\xa028, 2012, finding that the Hurd Settlement Agreement required Oracle to continue to develop certain of its software products for use on HP\\x92s Itanium-based servers and to port such\\nproducts at no cost to HP for as long as HP sells those servers (the Phase One Ruling). A jury trial began on May\\xa023, 2016. On June\\xa030, 2016, the jury returned a verdict in favor of HP on its claims for breach of contract and breach of the\\nimplied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and \\n \\xa0 121 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued) \\nMay 31, 2018  \\xa0\\n \\nagainst Oracle on its claim for violation of the Lanham Act (the Phase Two Jury Verdict). The jury awarded HP damages in the amount of $3.0\\xa0billion, and HP is entitled to post-judgment\\ninterest on this award. On August\\xa030, 2016, the court denied HP\\x92s motion for pre-judgment interest. Judgment was entered on October\\xa020, 2016. Oracle posted certain court-mandated surety bonds\\nwith the court in order to proceed with its motion for a new trial and entered into related indemnification agreements with each of the surety bond issuing companies. Oracle filed a motion for a new trial on November\\xa014, 2016, which was denied.\\n Oracle filed its notice of appeal on January\\xa017, 2017, specifying that it was appealing the trial court\\x92s Phase One Ruling and Phase Two\\nJury Verdict. On February\\xa02, 2017, HP filed a notice of appeal of the trial court\\x92s denial of pre-judgment interest. No amounts have been paid or recorded to our results of operations either prior to\\nor subsequent to the Phase One Ruling or Phase Two Jury Verdict. We continue to believe that we have meritorious defenses against HP\\x92s claims, and we intend to present these defenses to the appellate court. Among the arguments we expect to make\\non appeal are the following: the trial court misapplied fundamental principles of contract law and misinterpreted the Hurd Settlement Agreement, including by disregarding the context of the Hurd Settlement Agreement and the evidence of the\\nparties\\x92 mutual intentions; that HP\\x92s breach of contract claim should fail as a matter of law because HP does not claim and did not prove that Oracle failed to deliver any software under the trial court\\x92s interpretation of the\\ncontract; that awarding HP both damages for breach of the Hurd Settlement Agreement and specific performance of that agreement constitutes an improper double recovery; and that the damages award is excessive, unsupported by the evidence, and\\ncontrary to law. We cannot currently estimate a reasonably possible range of loss for this action due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the appeal process and the nature of the claims. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the\\noutcome of the appeal process related to this action is uncertain. It is possible that the resolution of this action could have a material impact to our future cash flows and results of operations. \\nDerivative Litigation  On May\\xa03, 2017, a stockholder\\nderivative lawsuit was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. The derivative suit is brought by an alleged stockholder of Oracle, purportedly on Oracle\\x92s behalf, against Oracle, our Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief\\nTechnology Officer in his capacities as a director, officer and an alleged controlling stockholder, one of our Chief Executive Officers (who is also a director), three other directors, and Oracle as a nominal defendant. Plaintiff alleges that the\\ndefendants breached their fiduciary duties by causing Oracle to agree to purchase NetSuite Inc. (NetSuite) at an excessive price. Plaintiff seeks declaratory relief, an order rescinding or reforming the NetSuite transaction, unspecified monetary\\ndamages (including interest), attorneys\\x92 fees and costs, and disgorgement of various unspecified profits, fees, compensation, and benefits. \\nOn July\\xa018, 2017, a second stockholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, brought by another alleged\\nstockholder of Oracle, purportedly on Oracle\\x92s behalf. The suit is brought against all current members and one former member of our Board of Directors, and Oracle as a nominal defendant. Plaintiff alleges that the defendants breached their\\nfiduciary duties by causing Oracle to agree to purchase NetSuite at an excessive price. Plaintiff seeks declaratory relief, unspecified monetary damages (including interest), and attorneys\\x92 fees and costs. \\nOn August\\xa09, 2017, the court consolidated the two derivative cases. In a September\\xa07, 2017 order, the court appointed plaintiff\\x92s\\ncounsel in the second case as lead plaintiffs\\x92 counsel and designated the July\\xa018, 2017 complaint as the operative complaint. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on October\\xa027, 2017, and after briefing and argument, the court\\ndenied this motion on March\\xa019, 2018. The parties stipulated that all of the individual defendants, except for our Chief Technology Officer and one of our Chief Executive Officers, should be dismissed from this case without prejudice, and on\\nMarch\\xa028, 2018, the court approved this stipulation. On May\\xa04, 2018, the remaining defendants answered plaintiff\\x92s complaint. \\n \\xa0 122 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued) \\nMay 31, 2018  \\xa0\\n On May\\xa04, 2018, the Board of Directors established a Special Litigation Committee (the SLC) to\\ninvestigate the allegations in this derivative action. Three outside directors serve on the SLC.  While Oracle continues to evaluate these claims,\\nwe do not believe this litigation will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.  Other Litigation \\nWe are party to various other legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, which arise in the ordinary course of business, including\\nproceedings and claims that relate to acquisitions we have completed or to companies we have acquired or are attempting to acquire. While the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the outcome of any of\\nthese matters, individually or in the aggregate, will result in losses that are materially in excess of amounts already recognized, if any. \\n \\xa0 123 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\n SCHEDULE II \\nORACLE CORPORATION  VALUATION

Our products are delivered to over 400,000\\xa0worldwide customers through a variety of\\nflexible and interoperable IT deployment models, including on-premise, cloud-based or hybrid, that enable customer choice and best meet customer IT needs.  Our Oracle Cloud offerings provide a comprehensive and fully integrated stack of application, platform, compute, storage and networking services in all three primary layers of the cloud: Software as a\\nService (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Our on-premise IT offerings include: Oracle Applications, Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware software, among others; hardware products including Oracle\\nEngineered Systems, servers, storage and industry-specific products, among others; and related support and services. We provide our cloud and on-premise offerings worldwide to businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions\\nand resellers with a sales force positioned to offer the combinations that best suit customer needs.  Our comprehensive and fully integrated\\nstack of Oracle Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings integrate the software, hardware and services on the customers\\x92 behalf in IT environments that we deploy, support and manage for the customer. Our integrated Oracle Cloud offerings are\\ndesigned to be rapidly deployable to enable customers to have shorter time to innovation; easily maintainable to reduce integration and testing work; connectable among differing deployment models to enable interchangeability and extendibility\\nbetween cloud and on-premise IT environments; compatible to easily move workloads between on-premise IT environments and the Oracle Cloud; cost-effective by requiring lower upfront customer investment; and secure, standards-based and reliable. We\\nare a leader in the core technologies of cloud IT environments, including database and middleware software as well as enterprise applications, virtualization, clustering, large-scale systems management and related infrastructure. Our products and\\nservices are the building blocks of our Oracle Cloud services, our partners\\x92 cloud services and our customers\\x92 cloud IT environments. \\nIn addition to providing a broad spectrum of cloud offerings, we develop and sell our applications, platform and infrastructure products and services to\\nour customers worldwide for use in their global data centers and on-premise IT environments. An important element of our corporate strategy is to continue our investments in, and innovation with respect to,\\nour products and services that we offer through our cloud and on-premise software, hardware and services businesses. In fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, we invested $6.2 billion, $5.8 billion and $5.5\\xa0billion, respectively, in research and\\ndevelopment to enhance our existing portfolio of offerings and products and to develop new technologies and services. We have a deep understanding as to how applications, platform and infrastructure technologies interact and function with one\\nanother within IT environments. We focus our development efforts on improving the performance, security, operation and integration of these differing technologies to make them more cost-effective and easier to deploy, manage and maintain for our\\ncustomers and to improve their computing performance relative to our competitors. After the initial purchase of Oracle products and services, our customers can continue to benefit from our research and development efforts and deep IT expertise by\\npurchasing and renewing Oracle support offerings for their on-premise deployments, which may include product enhancements that we periodically deliver to our products, and/or by renewing their SaaS, PaaS and IaaS contracts with us. \\nAs customers deploy with the Oracle Cloud, many are adopting a hybrid IT model whereby certain of their IT\\xa0instances are deployed using the Oracle\\nCloud, while other of their IT instances are deployed using Oracle on-premise offerings, and both are designed with capabilities to be manageable as one. Our Oracle Cloud at Customer program provides another\\ndeployment option that utilizes the Oracle Cloud Machine and Oracle Database Exadata Cloud Machine to bring certain Oracle Cloud PaaS and IaaS offerings to a customer\\x92s on-premise IT environment to meet\\ndata sovereignty, data residency, data protection and regulatory business policy requirements, among others, while benefiting from many advantages of a cloud service.  A selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. We believe that our acquisitions enhance the products and services that we can offer to customers, expand\\nour customer base, \\n \\xa0 3 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nprovide greater scale to accelerate innovation, grow our revenues and earnings, and increase stockholder value. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of\\ncompanies, products, services and technologies that add to, are complementary to, or have otherwise enhanced our existing offerings. On November\\xa07, 2016, we acquired NetSuite Inc. (NetSuite). Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial\\nStatements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, provides additional information related to our acquisition of NetSuite. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies to further our corporate strategy.\\n We have three businesses:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n our cloud and on-premise software business, which is comprised of a single operating segment and includes our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings,\\non-premise new software licenses offerings, and software license updates and product support offerings, represented 80%, 78% and 77% of our total revenues in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n our hardware business, which is comprised of a single operating segment and includes our on-premise hardware products and related hardware support\\nservices offerings, represented 11%, 13% and 14% of our total revenues in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively; and  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n our services business, which is comprised of a single operating segment, represented 9% of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015.\\n In recent periods, customer demand has increased at a greater rate for cloud-based IT deployment models relative to\\non-premise IT deployment models. Our chief operating decision makers (CODMs), which consist of our Chief Executive Officers and Chief Technology Officer, view the operating results of our three businesses and allocate resources in a manner that is\\nconsistent with the changing market dynamics that we have experienced. As a result, during fiscal 2017, we updated our operating segments. Management\\x92s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 16 of\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements, both included elsewhere in this Annual Report, provide additional information related to our businesses and operating segments, including the recasting of our segment\\x92s financial information from\\nprior periods to conform with the current year\\x92s presentation.  Oracle Corporation was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and\\nis the successor to operations originally begun in June 1977.  Applications, Platform and Infrastructure Technologies \\nOracle\\x92s comprehensive portfolio of applications, platform and infrastructure technologies is designed to address an organization\\x92s IT\\nenvironment needs including business process, infrastructure and development requirements, among others. Oracle applications, platform and infrastructure technologies are based upon industry standards and are designed to be enterprise-grade,\\nreliable, scalable and secure. We offer our applications, platform and infrastructure technologies through our cloud and on-premise software, hardware and services businesses and deliver them through flexible and interoperable cloud-based,\\non-premise and hybrid deployment models that enable customer choice and best meet customer IT needs.  In recent periods, customer demand has\\nincreased at a greater rate for cloud-based IT deployment models relative to on-premise IT deployment models. To address this demand, we have increased our investment in and focus on the development, marketing and sale of our cloud-based\\napplications, platform and infrastructure technologies resulting in higher growth of our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues as customer preferences have pivoted to the Oracle Cloud for new deployments and as customers migrate to and expand with the\\nOracle Cloud for their existing on-premise workloads. We expect these trends to continue.  We believe that offering customers broad,\\ncomprehensive, flexible and interoperable deployment models for our applications, platform and infrastructure technologies is important to our growth strategy and better addresses customer needs relative to our competitors, many of whom provide\\nfewer offerings and more restrictive deployment models. \\n \\xa0 4 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Applications Technologies  Our applications technologies consist of comprehensive cloud-based and on-premise software offerings including our Oracle Cloud SaaS offerings, which are available for customers as a subscription, and\\nOracle Applications offerings, which are available for customers to purchase as an on-premise software license with the option to purchase related software support. Regardless of the deployment model selected, our applications technologies are\\ndesigned to reduce the risk, cost and complexity of our customers\\x92 IT infrastructures, while supporting customer choice with flexible deployment models that readily enable agility, compatibility and extendibility. \\nOur applications technologies are generally designed using an industry standards-based architecture to manage and automate core business functions across\\nthe enterprise, as well as to help customers differentiate and innovate in those processes unique to their industries or organizations. In addition to applications that are deployable to meet a number of business automation requirements across a\\nbroad range of industries, we also offer industry-specific applications through a focused strategy of investments in internal development and strategic acquisitions. Our industry-specific applications provide solutions to customers in\\ncommunications, construction and engineering, financial services, health sciences, hospitality and retail, manufacturing, public sectors and utilities, among others.

Outside the United States, our international subsidiaries sell, support and service our offerings in their local countries as well as within other foreign countries where we do not operate through a direct sales subsidiary.\\nOur geographic coverage allows us to draw on business and technical expertise from a global workforce, provides stability to our operations and revenue streams to offset geography specific economic trends and offers us an opportunity to take\\nadvantage of new markets for our offerings. Our international operations subject us to certain risks, which are more fully described in \\x93Risk Factors\\x94 included in Item\\xa01A of this Annual Report. A summary of our domestic and\\ninternational revenues and long-lived assets is set forth in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.  We also market our product offerings worldwide through indirect channels. The companies that comprise our indirect channel network are members of the Oracle Partner Network. The Oracle Partner Network is\\na global program that manages our business relationships with a large, broad-based network of companies, including independent software and hardware vendors, system integrators and resellers that deliver innovative solutions and services based upon\\nour product offerings. By offering our partners access to our product offerings, educational information, technical services, marketing and sales support, the Oracle Partner Network program extends our market reach by providing our partners with the\\nresources they need to be successful in delivering solutions to customers globally. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels including independent distributors and value-added resellers. \\nResearch and Development  We develop the\\nsubstantial majority of our product offerings internally. In addition, we have extended our product offerings and intellectual property through acquisitions of businesses and technologies. We also purchase or license intellectual property rights in\\ncertain circumstances. Internal development allows us to maintain technical control over the design and development of our products. We have a number of United States and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our\\nproducts and technology. While we believe that our patents have value, no single patent is essential to us or to any of our principal businesses. Research and development expenditures were $6.2 billion, $5.8 billion and $5.5 billion in fiscal 2017,\\n2016 and 2015, respectively, or 16%, 16% and 14% of total revenues in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Rapid technological advances in hardware and software development, evolving standards in computer hardware and software technology,\\nchanging customer needs and frequent new product introductions, offerings and enhancements characterize the cloud and on-premise software and hardware markets in which we compete. We plan to continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to\\nresearch and development efforts to maintain and improve our current product and services offerings.  Employees \\nAs of May\\xa031, 2017, we employed approximately 138,000 full-time employees, including approximately 39,000\\xa0in sales and marketing, approximately\\n8,000 in our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS operations, approximately 9,000 in software license updates and product support, approximately 5,000 in hardware, approximately 24,000 in services, approximately 40,000 in research and development and\\napproximately 13,000 in general and administrative positions. Of these employees, approximately 51,000 were employed in the United States and approximately 87,000 were employed internationally. None of our employees in the United States is\\nrepresented by a labor union; however, in certain foreign subsidiaries, labor unions or workers\\x92 councils represent some of our employees. \\nSeasonality and Cyclicality  Our\\nquarterly revenues have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including the structure of our sales force incentive compensation plans, which are common in the technology industry. In each fiscal year, our total revenues and\\noperating margins are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fiscal quarter. The operating margins of our businesses (in particular, our cloud and on-premise software business and hardware business) are generally\\naffected by seasonal factors in a similar manner as our revenues as certain expenses within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short term. See \\x93Selected Quarterly Financial Data\\x94\\n\\n \\xa0 19 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nin Item\\xa07 of this Annual Report for a more complete description of the seasonality and cyclicality of our revenues, expenses and margins. \\nCompetition  We face intense competition\\nin all aspects of our business. The nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as firms emerge, expand or are acquired, as technology evolves and as customer demands and competitive pressures otherwise\\nchange.  Our customers are demanding less complexity and lower total cost in the implementation, sourcing, integration and ongoing maintenance\\nof their enterprise software and hardware. Our enterprise cloud and on-premise software and hardware offerings compete directly with certain offerings from some of the largest and most competitive companies in the world, including Amazon.com, Inc.,\\nMicrosoft Corporation (Microsoft), International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), Intel and SAP SE and as well as other companies like Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, salesforce.com, inc. and Workday, Inc. In addition, due to the low barriers to\\nentry in many of our market segments, new technologies and new and growing competitors frequently emerge to challenge our offerings. Our competitors range from companies offering broad IT solutions across many of our lines of business to vendors\\nproviding point solutions, or offerings focused on a specific functionality, product area or industry. In addition, as we expand into new market segments, we face increased competition as we compete with existing competitors, as well as firms that\\nmay be partners in other areas of our business and other firms with whom we have not previously competed. Moreover, we or our competitors may take certain strategic actions\\x97including acquisitions, partnerships and joint ventures, or\\nrepositioning of product lines\\x97which invite even greater competition in one or more product offering categories.  Key competitive factors\\nin each of the segments in which we currently compete and may compete in the future include: total cost of ownership, performance, scalability, reliability, security, functionality, efficiency, speed to production and quality of technical support.\\nOur product and service sales (and the relative strength of our products and services versus those of our competitors) are also directly and indirectly affected by the following, among other things: \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the adoption of cloud-based IT offerings including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n ease of deployment, use and maintenance of our products and services offerings; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n compatibility between Oracle products and services deployed within on-premise IT environments and public cloud IT environments, including our Oracle\\nCloud environments;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the adoption of commodity servers and microprocessors; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the broader \\x93platform\\x94 competition between our industry standard Java technology platform and the .NET programming environment of Microsoft;\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n operating system competition among our Oracle Solaris and Linux operating systems, with alternatives including Microsoft\\x92s Windows Server, and\\nother UNIX and Linux operating systems;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the adoption of open source alternatives to commercial software by enterprise software customers; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n products, features and functionality developed internally by customers and their IT staff; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n products, features and functionality customized and implemented for customers by consultants, systems integrators or other third parties; and\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n attractiveness of offerings from business processing outsourcers.

The following discussion, as well\\nas our \\x93Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\x94 discussion in Management\\x92s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 7), highlights some of these risks. The risks described below are not\\nexhaustive and you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our securities.  Our Oracle Cloud\\nstrategy, including our Oracle Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Data as a Service (DaaS) offerings, may adversely affect our revenues and\\nprofitability.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We provide our cloud and on-premise offerings to customers worldwide via deployment models that best suit their needs, including via our cloud-based SaaS, PaaS, IaaS and DaaS offerings. As customers\\ndeploy with the Oracle Cloud, many are adopting a hybrid IT model whereby certain of their IT instances are deployed using the Oracle Cloud, while other of their IT instances are deployed using Oracle on-premise offerings. As these business models\\ncontinue to evolve, we may not be able to compete effectively, generate significant revenues or maintain the profitability of our cloud offerings. Additionally, the increasing prevalence of cloud and SaaS delivery models offered by us and our\\ncompetitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our on-premise enterprise software offerings and our cloud offerings, and has a dampening impact on overall demand for our on-premise software product and service offerings, which has reduced and\\ncould continue to reduce our revenues and profitability, at least in the near term. If we do not successfully execute our cloud computing strategy or anticipate the cloud computing needs of our customers, our reputation as a cloud services provider\\ncould be harmed and our revenues and profitability could decline.  As customer demand for our cloud offerings increases, we experience\\nvolatility in our reported revenues and operating results due to the differences in timing of revenue recognition between our new software licenses and hardware arrangements relative to our cloud offering arrangements. Customers generally purchase\\nour cloud offerings on a subscription basis and revenues from these offerings are generally recognized ratably over the terms of the subscriptions. The deferred revenue that results from sales of our cloud offerings may prevent any deterioration in\\nsales activity associated with our cloud offerings from becoming immediately observable in our consolidated statement of operations. This is in contrast to revenues associated with our new software licenses arrangements whereby new software licenses\\nrevenues are generally recognized in full at the time of delivery of the related software licenses. We incur certain expenses associated with the infrastructures and marketing of our cloud offerings in advance of our ability to recognize the\\nrevenues associated with these offerings.  We have also acquired a number of cloud computing companies, and the integration of these companies\\ninto our Oracle Cloud strategy may not be as efficient or scalable as anticipated, which could adversely affect our ability to fully realize the benefits anticipated from these acquisitions.  Our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and services, integrate acquired products and services and enhance our existing products and\\nservices.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Rapid technological advances, changing delivery models and evolving standards in computer hardware and software development and communications infrastructure, changing and increasingly sophisticated customer\\nneeds and frequent new product introductions and enhancements characterize the industries in which we compete. If we are unable to develop new or sufficiently differentiated products and services, enhance and improve our product offerings and\\nsupport services in a timely manner or position and price our products and services to meet demand, customers may not purchase or subscribe to our software, hardware or cloud offerings or renew software support, hardware support or cloud\\nsubscriptions contracts. Renewals of these contracts are important to the growth of our business. In addition, we cannot provide any assurance that the standards on which we choose to develop new products will allow us to compete effectively for\\nbusiness opportunities in emerging areas. \\n \\xa0 22 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n We have continued to refresh and release new offerings of our cloud and on-premise software and hardware\\nproducts and services, including our Database Multitenant, Database In-Memory, SaaS, PaaS, Generation 2 IaaS, Version 12.2 DaaS and Oracle Engineered Systems offerings. Our business may be adversely affected if: \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we do not continue to develop and release these or other new or enhanced products and services within the anticipated time frames;\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n there is a delay in market acceptance of new, enhanced or acquired product lines or services; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n there are changes in information technology (IT) trends that we do not adequately anticipate or address with our product development efforts;\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we do not timely optimize complementary product lines and services; or \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we fail to adequately integrate, support or enhance acquired product lines or services. \\nIf our security measures for our products and services are compromised and as a result, our data, our customers\\x92 data or our IT systems are\\naccessed improperly, made unavailable, or improperly modified, our products and services may be perceived as vulnerable, our brand and reputation could be damaged, the IT services we provide to our customers could be disrupted, and customers may\\nstop using our products and services, all of which could reduce our revenue and earnings, increase our expenses and expose us to legal claims and regulatory actions.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We are in the IT business, and our products and\\nservices, including our Oracle Cloud offerings, store, retrieve, manipulate and manage our customers\\x92 information and data, external data, as well as our own data. We have a reputation for secure and reliable product offerings and related\\nservices and we have invested a great deal of time and resources in protecting the integrity and security of our products, services and the internal and external data that we manage.  At times, we encounter attempts by third parties (which may include nation states and individuals sponsored by them) to identify and exploit product and service vulnerabilities, penetrate or bypass our\\nsecurity measures, and gain unauthorized access to our or our customers\\x92, partners\\x92 and suppliers\\x92 software, hardware and cloud offerings, networks and systems, any of which could lead to the compromise of personal information or the\\nconfidential information or data of Oracle or our customers. Computer hackers and others may be able to develop and deploy IT related viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that could attack our networks, systems, products and\\nservices, exploit potential security vulnerabilities of our networks, systems, products and services, create system disruptions and cause shutdowns or denials of service. This is also true for third-party data, products or services incorporated into\\nour own. Data may also be accessed or modified improperly as a result of customer, partner, employee or supplier error or malfeasance and third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce customers, partners, employees or suppliers into disclosing\\nsensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our data, our customers\\x92, suppliers\\x92 or partners\\x92 data or the IT systems of Oracle, its customers, suppliers or partners. \\nHigh-profile security breaches at other companies have increased in recent years, and security industry experts and government officials have warned about\\nthe risks of hackers and cyber-attacks targeting IT products and businesses. Although this is an industry-wide problem that affects software and hardware companies generally, it affects Oracle in particular because computer hackers tend to focus\\ntheir efforts on the most prominent IT\\xa0companies, and they may focus on Oracle because of our reputation for, and marketing efforts associated with, having secure products and services. These risks will increase as we continue to grow our cloud\\nofferings and store and process increasingly large amounts of data, including personal information and our customers\\x92 confidential information and data and other external data, and host or manage parts of our customers\\x92 businesses in\\ncloud-based IT environments, especially in customer sectors involving particularly sensitive data such as health sciences, financial services and the government. We also have an active acquisition program and have acquired a number of companies,\\nproducts, services and technologies over the years. While we make significant efforts to address any IT security issues with respect to our acquired companies, we may still inherit such risks when we integrate these companies within Oracle.\\n We could suffer significant damage to our brand and reputation if a cyber-attack or other security incident were to allow unauthorized access\\nto or modification of our customers\\x92 or suppliers\\x92 data, other external data, or our \\n \\xa0 23 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nown data or our IT systems or if the services we provide to our customers were disrupted, or if our products or services are perceived as having security vulnerabilities. Customers could lose\\nconfidence in the security and reliability of our products and services, including our cloud offerings, and perceive them to be not secure. This could lead to fewer customers using our products and services and result in reduced revenue and\\nearnings. The costs we would incur to address and fix these security incidents would increase our expenses. These types of security incidents could also lead to lawsuits, regulatory investigations and claims and increased legal liability, including\\nin some cases contractual costs related to customer notification and fraud monitoring.  Our business practices with respect to the\\ncollection, use and management of personal information could give rise to operational interruption, liabilities or reputational harm as a result of governmental regulation, legal requirements or industry standards relating to consumer privacy and\\ndata protection.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0As regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase and worldwide laws and regulations concerning the handling of personal information expand and become more complex, potential risks related to\\ndata collection and use within our business will intensify. For example, the European Union (EU) and the United States (U.S.) formally entered into a new framework in July 2016 that provides a mechanism for companies to transfer data from EU member\\nstates to the U.S. This new framework, called the Privacy Shield, is intended to address shortcomings identified by the Court of Justice of the EU in the previous EU-U.S. Safe Harbor Framework, which the Court of Justice invalidated in October 2015.\\nThe Privacy Shield and other data transfer mechanisms are likely to be reviewed by the European courts, which may lead to uncertainty about the legal basis for data transfers to the U.S. or interruption of such transfers. In the event any court\\nblocks transfers to or from a particular jurisdiction on the basis that no transfer mechanisms are legally adequate, this could give rise to operational interruption in the performance of services for customers and internal processing of employee\\ninformation, regulatory liabilities or reputational harm.  In addition, U.S. and foreign governments have enacted or are considering enacting\\nlegislation or regulations, or may in the near future interpret existing legislation or regulations, in a manner that could significantly impact the ability of Oracle and our customers and data partners to collect, augment, analyze, use, transfer\\nand share personal and other information that is integral to certain services Oracle provides. This could be true particularly in those jurisdictions where privacy laws or regulators take a broader view of how personal information is defined,\\ntherefore subjecting the handling of such data to heightened restrictions that may be obstructive to the operations of Oracle and its customers and data providers. This impact may be acute in countries that have passed or are considering passing\\nlegislation that requires data to remain localized \\x93in country,\\x94 as this imposes financial costs on any service provider that is required to store data in jurisdictions not of its choosing and nonstandard operational processes that are\\ndifficult and costly to integrate with global processes.  Regulators globally are also imposing greater monetary fines for privacy violations.\\nFor example, in 2016, the EU adopted a new law governing data practices and privacy called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which becomes effective in May 2018. The law establishes new requirements regarding the handling of personal\\ndata. Non-compliance with the GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue. The GDPR and other changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of sensitive data, such as healthcare\\ndata or other personal information, could greatly increase our cost of providing our products and services or even prevent us from offering certain services in jurisdictions that we operate. Additionally, public perception and standards related to\\nthe privacy of personal information can shift rapidly, in ways that may affect Oracle\\x92s reputation or influence regulators to enact regulations and laws that may limit Oracle\\x92s ability to provide certain products. Any failure, or perceived\\nfailure, by Oracle to comply with U.S. federal, state, or foreign laws and regulations, including laws and regulations regulating privacy, data security, or consumer protection, or other policies, public perception, standards, self-regulatory\\nrequirements or legal obligations, could result in lost or restricted business, proceedings, actions or fines brought against us or levied by governmental entities or others, or could adversely affect our business and harm our reputation.\\n We might experience significant coding, manufacturing or configuration errors in our cloud, software and hardware\\nofferings.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Despite testing prior to the release and throughout the lifecycle of a product or service, our cloud, software and hardware offerings sometimes contain coding or manufacturing errors that can impact their\\nfunction, performance and security, and result in other negative consequences. The detection and correction of any errors in released cloud, software or hardware offerings can be time consuming and costly. Errors in our\\n\\n \\xa0 24 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\ncloud, software or hardware offerings could affect their ability to properly function or operate with other cloud, software or hardware offerings, could delay the development or release of new\\nproducts or services or new versions of products or services, could create security vulnerabilities in our products or services, and could adversely affect market acceptance of our products or services. This includes third-party software products or\\nservices incorporated into our own. If we experience errors or delays in releasing our cloud, software or hardware offerings or new versions thereof, our sales could be affected and revenues could decline. In addition, we run Oracle\\x92s business\\noperations as well as cloud and other services that we offer to our customers on our products and networks. Therefore, any flaws could affect our ability to conduct our business operations and the operations of our customers. Enterprise customers\\nrely on our cloud, software and hardware offerings and services to run their businesses and errors in our cloud, software or hardware offerings could expose us to product liability, performance and warranty claims as well as significant harm to our\\nbrand and reputation, which could impact our future sales.  We may fail to achieve our financial forecasts due to inaccurate sales\\nforecasts or other factors.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our revenues, particularly our cloud revenues, new software licenses revenues and hardware revenues, are difficult to forecast. As a result, our quarterly operating results can fluctuate\\nsubstantially.   We use a \\x93pipeline\\x94 system, a common industry practice, to forecast sales and trends in our business.\\nOur sales personnel monitor the status of all proposals and estimate when a customer will make a purchase decision and the dollar amount of the sale. These estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline. Our pipeline estimates\\ncan prove to be unreliable both in a particular quarter and over a longer period of time, in part because the \\x93conversion rate\\x94 or \\x93closure rate\\x94 of the pipeline into contracts can be very difficult to estimate. We may use\\nconversion or renewal rates in our forecasts for our cloud business that differ materially from our actual conversion or renewal rates because this business is continuing to evolve and such rates may be unpredictable. A reduction in the conversion\\nrate, or in the pipeline itself, could cause us to plan or budget incorrectly and adversely affect our business or results of operations. In particular, a slowdown in IT spending or economic conditions generally can unexpectedly reduce the\\nconversion rate in particular periods as purchasing decisions are delayed, reduced in amount or cancelled. The conversion rate can also be affected by the tendency of some of our customers to wait until the end of a fiscal period in the hope of\\nobtaining more favorable terms, which can also impede our ability to negotiate, execute and deliver upon these contracts in a timely manner. In addition, for newly acquired companies, we have limited ability to predict how their pipelines will\\nconvert into sales or revenues for a number of quarters following the acquisition. Conversion rates post-acquisition may be quite different from the acquired companies\\x92 historical conversion rates. Differences in conversion rates can also be\\naffected by changes in business practices that we implement in our newly acquired companies. These changes may negatively affect customer behavior.  A substantial portion of our new software licenses and hardware contracts is completed in the latter part of a quarter and a significant percentage of these are larger orders. Because a significant\\nportion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the short term, sales and revenue shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability. The number of large new software licenses transactions and, to a lesser extent,\\nhardware products transactions increases the risk of fluctuations in our quarterly results because a delay in even a small number of these transactions could cause our quarterly sales, revenues and profitability to fall significantly short of our\\npredictions.  We may experience foreign currency gains and losses. Changes in currency exchange rates can adversely affect customer\\ndemand and our revenue and profitability.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We conduct a significant number of transactions and hold cash in currencies other than the U.S.\\xa0Dollar. Changes in the values of major foreign currencies, particularly the\\nEuro, Japanese Yen and British Pound, relative to the U.S.\\xa0Dollar can significantly affect our total assets, revenues, operating results and cash flows, which are reported in U.S. Dollars. In particular, the economic uncertainties relating to\\nEuropean sovereign and other debt obligations may cause the value of the Euro to fluctuate relative to the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in foreign currency rates, including the strengthening of the U.S.\\xa0Dollar against the Euro and most other major\\ninternational currencies, adversely affects our revenue growth in terms of the amounts that we report in U.S. Dollars after converting our foreign currency results into U.S. Dollars and in terms of actual demand for our products and services as\\ncertain of these products may become relatively more expensive for foreign currency-based enterprises to purchase. In addition, currency \\n \\xa0 25 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nvariations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the U.S. Generally, our revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens\\nrelative to other currencies and are positively affected when the dollar weakens. In addition, our reported assets generally are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies as a portion of our consolidated cash and\\nbank deposits, among other assets, are held in foreign currencies. The U.S.\\xa0Dollar continued to strengthen relative to other currencies in fiscal 2017, which is reflected in our results.  In addition, we incur foreign currency transaction gains and losses, primarily related to sublicense fees and other intercompany agreements among us and our subsidiaries that we expect to cash settle in\\nthe near term, which are charged against earnings in the period incurred. We have a program which primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts designed to offset the risks associated with certain foreign currency exposures. We may suspend\\nthe program from time to time. As a part of this program, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset at least in part by gains or losses on the foreign currency\\nforward contracts in an effort to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transaction gains or losses. A large portion of our consolidated operations are international, and we expect that we will continue to realize\\ngains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts. For example, we will experience foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances if it is not possible or\\ncost-effective to hedge our foreign currency exposures, if our hedging efforts are ineffective, or should we suspend our foreign currency forward contract program. Our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will\\ngenerally depend on the size and type of cross-currency exposures that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, whether we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to offset\\nthese exposures and other factors.\\xa0All of these factors could materially impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  Certain of our international subsidiaries operate in economies that have been designated as highly inflationary. We have incurred foreign currency losses associated with the devaluation of currencies in\\nthese highly inflationary economies relative to the U.S.\\xa0Dollar and we may continue to incur such losses in these countries or other emerging market countries where we do business.  Economic, political and market conditions can adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability, which in turn could\\nadversely affect our stock price.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our business is influenced by a range of factors that are beyond our control and that we have no comparative advantage in forecasting. These include: \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n general economic and business conditions;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n overall demand for enterprise cloud, software and hardware products and services; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n governmental budgetary constraints or shifts in government spending priorities; and \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n general political developments.  Macroeconomic developments like the developments associated with the United Kingdom\\x92s vote to exit the European Union or the occurrence of similar events in other countries that lead to uncertainty\\nor instability in economic, political or market conditions could negatively affect our business, operating results, financial condition and outlook, which, in turn, could adversely affect our stock price. Any general weakening of, and related\\ndeclining corporate confidence in, the global economy or the curtailment of government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce or eliminate their IT budgets and spending, which could cause customers to delay,\\ndecrease or cancel purchases of our products and services or cause customers not to pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services.  In addition, political unrest in places like Syria, Ukraine, Iraq, Venezuela and Turkey and the related potential impact on global stability, terrorist attacks and the potential for other hostilities in\\nvarious parts of the world, potential public health crises and natural disasters continue to contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including our\\nrevenue growth and profitability. These factors generally have the strongest effect on our sales of new software licenses, \\n \\xa0 26 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nhardware and related services and, to a lesser extent, also may affect our renewal rates for software license updates and product support and our subscription-based cloud offerings. \\nIf we are unable to compete effectively, the results of operations and prospects for our business could be harmed.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We\\nface intense competition in all aspects of our business. The nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as firms emerge, expand or are acquired, as technology evolves and as delivery models change. Many\\nvendors develop and market databases, middleware products, application development tools, business applications, collaboration products and business intelligence products, among others, that compete with our cloud and on-premise software offerings.\\nThese vendors include on-premise software companies and companies that offer cloud-based SaaS, PaaS, IaaS and DaaS offerings and business process outsourcing (BPO) as competitive alternatives to buying software and hardware. Our competitors that\\noffer business applications and middleware products may influence a customer\\x92s purchasing decision for the underlying database in an effort to persuade potential customers not to acquire our products. We could lose customers if our competitors\\nintroduce new competitive products, add new functionality, acquire competitive products, reduce prices, better execute on their sales and marketing strategies or form strategic alliances with other companies. We may also face increasing competition\\nfrom open source software initiatives in which competitors may provide software and intellectual property for free. Existing or new competitors could gain sales opportunities or customers at our expense. \\nOur hardware business competes with, among others, (1)\\xa0systems manufacturers and resellers of systems based on our own microprocessors and operating\\nsystems and those of our competitors, (2)\\xa0microprocessor/chip manufacturers, (3)\\xa0providers of storage products, (4)\\xa0certain industry-specific hardware manufacturers including those serving communications, hospitality and retail\\nindustries and (5)\\xa0certain cloud providers that build their own IT infrastructures. Our hardware business causes us to compete with certain companies that historically have been partners. Some of these competitors may have more experience than\\nwe do in managing a hardware business. A significant portion of our hardware products are based on our SPARC microprocessor and Oracle Solaris operating system platform, which has a smaller installed base than certain of our competitors\\x92\\nplatforms and which may make it difficult for us to win new customers that have already made significant investments in our competitors\\x92 platforms. Certain of these competitors also compete very aggressively on price. A loss in our competitive\\nposition could result in lower revenues or profitability, which could adversely impact our ability to realize the revenue and profitability forecasts for our hardware business.  We may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The intense competition we face in the sales of our products and services and general economic and\\nbusiness conditions can put pressure on us to change our prices. If our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable, we may need to lower prices or offer other\\nfavorable terms in order to compete successfully. Any such changes may reduce margins and could adversely affect operating results. Additionally, the increasing prevalence of cloud delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably\\nimpact the pricing of our on-premise software, hardware and services offerings, which could reduce our revenues and profitability. Our software license updates and product support fees and hardware support fees are generally priced as a percentage\\nof our net new software licenses fees and net new hardware products fees, respectively. Our competitors may offer lower pricing on their support offerings, which could put pressure on us to further discount our offerings or support pricing.\\n Any broad-based change to our prices and pricing policies could cause our revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and\\nour customers adjust to the new pricing policies. Some of our competitors may bundle products for promotional purposes or as a long-term pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations. These practices could, over time,\\nsignificantly constrain the prices that we can charge for certain of our products. If we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of our products or changes in customer demand, our revenues could decrease. The increase in\\nopen source software distribution may also cause us to change our pricing models.  Our international sales and operations subject us to\\nadditional risks that can adversely affect our operating results.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from, and have significant operations, outside of the U.S. Our international operations include cloud\\noperations, cloud, software and hardware development, \\n \\xa0 27 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nmanufacturing, assembly, sales, customer support, consulting and other services and shared administrative service centers.  Compliance with international and U.S.\\xa0laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations\\ninclude U.S.\\xa0laws and local laws which include data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, prohibitions on payments to governmental officials, import and trade restrictions and export requirements.\\nViolations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer\\nour products and services in one or more countries, could delay or prevent potential acquisitions and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our\\nbusiness and our operating results. Compliance with these laws requires a significant amount of management attention and effort, which may divert management\\x92s attention from running our business operations and could harm our ability to grow our\\nbusiness, or may increase our expenses as we engage specialized or other additional resources to assist us with our compliance efforts. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties. We monitor\\nour operations and investigate allegations of improprieties relating to transactions and the way in which such transactions are recorded. Where circumstances warrant, we provide information and report our findings to government authorities, but no\\nassurance can be given that action will not be taken by such authorities.  We are also subject to a variety of other risks and challenges in\\nmanaging an organization operating in various countries, including those related to:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n general economic conditions in each country or region; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n fluctuations in currency exchange rates and related impacts to customer demand and our operating results; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n difficulties in transferring funds from or converting currencies in certain countries such as Venezuela that have led to a devaluation of our net\\nassets, in particular our cash assets, in that country\\x92s currency;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n regulatory changes, including government austerity measures in certain countries that we may not be able to sufficiently plan for or avoid that may\\nunexpectedly impair bank deposits or other cash assets that we hold in these countries or that impose additional taxes that we may be required to pay in these countries; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n political unrest, terrorism and the potential for other hostilities, including those in Syria, Ukraine, Iraq, Venezuela and Turkey;\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n common local business behaviors that are in direct conflict with our business ethics, practices and conduct policies; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n natural disasters;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, wildfires and increased storm sensitivity); \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n overlapping tax regimes;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n our ability to repatriate funds held by our foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. at favorable tax rates; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n public health risks, particularly in areas in which we have significant operations; and \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.  The variety of risks and challenges listed above could also disrupt or otherwise negatively impact the supply chain operations for our hardware business and the sales of our products and services in\\naffected countries or regions. \\n \\xa0 28 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n As the majority shareholder of Oracle Financial Services Software Limited, a publicly traded company in\\nIndia, and Oracle Corporation Japan, a publicly traded company in Japan, we are faced with several additional risks, including being subject to local securities regulations and being unable to exert full control that we would otherwise have if these\\nentities were wholly-owned subsidiaries.  Acquisitions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that\\nwere contemplated at the time of a transaction.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We continue to invest billions of dollars to acquire companies, products, services and technologies. We have a selective and active acquisition program and we expect to\\ncontinue to make acquisitions in the future because acquisitions are an important element of our overall corporate strategy. Risks we may face in connection with our acquisition program include:  \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n our ongoing business may be disrupted and our management\\x92s attention may be diverted by acquisition, transition or integration activities;\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may have difficulties (1)\\xa0managing an acquired company\\x92s technologies or lines of business; (2)\\xa0entering new markets where we have no\\nor limited direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions; or (3)\\xa0retaining key personnel from the acquired companies; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n an acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected, we may not integrate an acquired company or technology as successfully as we\\nexpected, we may impose our business practices or alter go-to-market strategies that adversely impact the acquired business or we may overpay for, or otherwise not realize the expected return on, our\\ninvestments, which could adversely affect our business or operating results and potentially cause impairment to assets that we recorded as a part of an acquisition including intangible assets and goodwill; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n our operating results or financial condition may be adversely impacted by (1)\\xa0claims or liabilities that we assume from an acquired company or\\ntechnology or that are otherwise related to an acquisition, including, among others, claims from government agencies, terminated employees, current or former customers, former stockholders or other third parties; (2)\\xa0pre-existing contractual\\nrelationships of an acquired company that we would not have otherwise entered into, the termination or modification of which may be costly or disruptive to our business; (3)\\xa0unfavorable revenue recognition or other accounting treatment as a\\nresult of an acquired company\\x92s practices; and (4)\\xa0intellectual property claims or disputes;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may fail to identify or assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring a company or technology,\\nwhich could result in unexpected litigation or regulatory exposure, unfavorable accounting treatment, unexpected increases in taxes due, a loss of anticipated tax benefits or other adverse effects on our business, operating results or financial\\ncondition;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may not realize the anticipated increase in our revenues from an acquisition for a number of reasons, including if a larger than predicted number of\\ncustomers decline to renew cloud-based subscription contracts or software or hardware support contracts, if we are unable to sell the acquired products or service offerings to our customer base or if contract models of an acquired company do not\\nallow us to recognize revenues on a timely basis;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technologies, products, services and their related supply chain operations with our existing lines of\\nbusiness and supply chain infrastructure and maintaining uniform standards, architecture, controls, procedures and policies;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may have multiple product lines or services offerings as a result of our acquisitions that are offered, priced and supported differently, which\\ncould cause customer confusion and delays;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may have higher than anticipated costs in continuing support and development of acquired products or services, in general and administrative\\nfunctions that support new business models, or in compliance with associated regulations that are more complicated than we had anticipated;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may be unable to obtain timely approvals from, or may otherwise have certain limitations, restrictions, penalties or other sanctions imposed on us\\nby, worker councils or similar bodies under applicable employment laws as a result of an acquisition, which could adversely affect our integration plans in certain jurisdictions and potentially increase our integration and restructuring expenses;\\n\\n \\xa0 29 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may be unable to obtain required approvals from governmental authorities under competition and antitrust laws on a timely basis, if at all, which\\ncould, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, adversely affect our integration plans in certain jurisdictions, otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of an acquisition or\\nhave other adverse effects on our current business and operations;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n our use of cash to pay for acquisitions may limit other potential uses of our cash, including stock repurchases, dividend payments and retirement of\\noutstanding indebtedness;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition and we\\nmay have to delay or not proceed with a substantial acquisition if we cannot obtain the necessary funding to complete the acquisition in a timely manner or on favorable terms; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n to the extent that we issue a significant amount of equity securities in connection with future acquisitions, existing stockholders may be diluted and\\nearnings per share may decrease; and  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may experience additional or unexpected changes in how we are required to account for our acquisitions pursuant to U.S. generally accepted\\naccounting principles, including arrangements that we assume from an acquisition.  The occurrence of any of these risks could\\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or several concurrent acquisitions.  Our hardware revenues and profitability have declined and could continue to decline.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our hardware business may adversely affect our overall profitability if we change\\nour business strategies, do not adapt to changes in market offerings or manage the associated risks. We may not achieve our estimated revenue, profit or other financial projections with respect to our hardware business in a timely manner or at all\\ndue to a number of factors, including:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n our changes in hardware strategies, offerings and technologies such as cloud infrastructure compute and storage services, including our own Oracle\\nCloud offerings, which could adversely affect demand for our on-premise hardware products;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n our hardware business has higher expenses as a percentage of revenues, and thus has been less profitable, than our cloud and on-premise software\\nbusiness;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n our focus on our more profitable Oracle Engineered Systems, such as our Oracle Exadata Database Machine, Oracle SuperCluster products and Oracle Cloud\\nat Customer portfolio, and the de-emphasis of our lower profit margin commodity hardware products, which could adversely affect our hardware revenues because the lower profit products have historically constituted a larger portion of our hardware\\nrevenues;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n changes in strategies for the development and introduction of new versions or next generations of our hardware products, including the pace at which we\\noffer new versions or next generations of our hardware products, and the related impacts from customers that may defer or delay purchases of existing hardware products and wait for these new releases, all of which could adversely affect our hardware\\nrevenues in the short term;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n a greater risk of material charges that could adversely affect our operating results, such as potential write-downs and impairments of our inventories;\\nhigher warranty expenses than what we experience in our cloud and on-premise software and services businesses; and amortization and potential impairment of intangible assets associated with our hardware business; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the close connection between hardware products (which have a finite life) and customer demand for related hardware support in which hardware products\\nthat approach the end of their useful lives are less likely to have hardware support contracts renewed by customers; and \\n \\xa0 30 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may acquire hardware companies that are strategically important to us but (1)\\xa0operate in hardware businesses with historically lower operating\\nmargins than our own; (2)\\xa0have different legacy business practices and go-to-market strategies than our own that we may alter as a part of our integration efforts, which may significantly impact our estimated revenues and profits from the\\nacquired company; (3)\\xa0leverage different platforms or competing technologies that we may encounter difficulties in integrating; or (4)\\xa0utilize unique manufacturing processes that affect our ability to scale these acquired products within\\nour own manufacturing operations.  Our hardware offerings are complex products, and if we cannot successfully manage\\nthis complexity, the results of our hardware business will suffer.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Designing, developing, manufacturing and introducing new hardware products are complicated processes. The development process for our hardware products\\nis uncertain and requires a high level of innovation. After the development phase, we must be able to forecast customer demand and manufacture new hardware products in sufficient volumes to meet this demand and do so in a cost-effective manner. Our\\n\\x93build-to-order\\x94 manufacturing model, in which our hardware products generally are not built until after customers place orders, may from time to time experience delays in delivering our hardware products to customers in a timely manner.\\nThese delays could cause our customers to purchase hardware products and services from our competitors. We must also manage new hardware product introductions and transitions to minimize the impact of customer delayed purchases of existing hardware\\nproducts in anticipation of new hardware product releases. It is also possible that we could experience design or manufacturing flaws, which could delay or prevent the production of the components for which we have previously committed to pay or\\nneed to fulfill orders from customers and could also prevent the production of our hardware products or cause our hardware products to be returned, recalled or rejected resulting in lost revenues, increases in warranty costs or costs related to\\nremediation efforts, damage to our reputation, penalties and litigation.  We depend on suppliers to design, develop, manufacture and deliver on\\na timely basis the necessary technologies and components for our hardware products, and there are some technologies and components that can only be purchased from a single vendor due to price, quality, technology, availability or other business\\nconstraints. As a result, our supply chain operations could be disrupted or negatively impacted by industry consolidation, natural disasters, political unrest, port stoppages or other transportation disruptions or slowdowns or other factors\\naffecting the countries or regions where these single source component vendors are located or where the products are being shipped. We may be unable to purchase these items from the respective single vendors on acceptable terms or may experience\\nsignificant delays or quality issues in the delivery of necessary technologies, parts or components from a particular vendor. If we had to find a new supplier for these technologies, parts and components, hardware product shipments could be delayed,\\nwhich would adversely affect our hardware revenues. We could also experience fluctuations in component prices which, if unanticipated, could negatively impact our hardware business cost structure. Additionally, we could experience changes in\\nshipping and logistics of our hardware products, which could result in fluctuations in prices and negatively impact our hardware margins. These factors may make it difficult for us to plan and procure appropriate component inventory levels in a\\ntimely fashion to meet customer demand for our hardware products. Therefore, we may experience component inventory shortages which may result in production delays or customers choosing to purchase fewer hardware products from us or hardware products\\nfrom our competitors. We negotiate supply commitments with vendors early in the manufacturing process to ensure we have sufficient technologies and components for our hardware products to meet anticipated customer demand. We must also manage our\\nlevels of older component inventories used in our hardware products to minimize inventory write-offs or write-downs. If we have excess inventory, it may be necessary to write-down the inventory, which would adversely affect our operating results. If\\none or more of the risks described above occurs, our hardware business and related operating results could be materially and adversely affected. \\nWe are susceptible to third-party manufacturing and logistics delays, which could result in the loss of sales and\\ncustomers.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We outsource the design, manufacturing, assembly and delivery of certain of our hardware products to a variety of companies, many of which are located outside the U.S. Our reliance on these third parties\\nreduces our control over the manufacturing and delivery process, exposing us to risks, including reduced control over quality assurance, product costs, product supply and delivery delays as well as the political and economic uncertainties and\\nnatural disasters of the international locations where certain of these third-party manufacturers \\n \\xa0 31 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nhave facilities and operations. Some countries may raise national security concerns or impose market access restrictions based on location of manufacture or sourcing. Any manufacturing disruption\\nor logistics delays by these third parties could impair our ability to fulfill orders for these hardware products for extended periods of time. If we are unable to manage our relationships with these third parties effectively, or if these third\\nparties experience delays, disruptions, capacity constraints, regulatory issues or quality control problems in their operations, or fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery, our ability to ship and deliver certain of our hardware\\nproducts to our customers could be impaired and our hardware business could be harmed.  We have simplified our supply chain processes by\\nreducing the number of third-party manufacturing partners and the number of locations where these third-party manufacturers build our hardware products. We therefore have become more dependent on a fewer number of these manufacturing partners and\\nlocations. If these partners experience production problems or delays or cannot meet our demand for products, we may not be able to find alternate manufacturing sources in a timely or cost-effective manner, if at all. If we are required to change\\nthird-party manufacturers, our ability to meet our scheduled hardware products deliveries to our customers could be adversely affected, which could cause the loss of sales and existing or potential customers, delayed revenue recognition or an\\nincrease in our hardware products expenses, all of which could adversely affect the margins of our hardware business.  These challenges and\\nrisks also exist when we acquire companies with hardware products and related supply chain operations. In some cases, we may be dependent, at least initially, on these acquired companies\\x92 supply chain operations that we are less familiar with\\nand thus we may be slower to adjust or react to these challenges and risks.  Our cloud, software and hardware indirect sales channel\\ncould affect our future operating results.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our cloud, software and hardware indirect channel network is comprised primarily of resellers, system integrators/implementers, consultants, education providers, internet\\nservice providers, network integrators and independent software vendors. Our relationships with these channel participants are important elements of our cloud, software and hardware marketing and sales efforts. Our financial results could be\\nadversely affected if our contracts with channel participants were terminated, if our relationships with channel participants were to deteriorate, if any of our competitors enter into strategic relationships with or acquire a significant channel\\nparticipant, if the financial condition or operations of our channel participants were to weaken or if the level of demand for our channel participants\\x92 products and services were to decrease. There can be no assurance that we will be\\nsuccessful in maintaining, expanding or developing our relationships with channel participants. If we are not successful, we may lose sales opportunities, customers and revenues.  We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We rely on copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, controls and\\ncontractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts, these protections may be limited. Unauthorized third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer portions of our products or otherwise obtain and use our\\nintellectual property. Any patents owned by us may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. Any of our pending or future patent applications, whether or not being currently challenged, may not be issued with the scope of the claims we seek, if at\\nall. In addition, the laws of some countries do not provide the same level of protection of our intellectual property rights as do the laws and courts of the U.S. If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or\\nuse, or other misappropriation, we may not remain competitive.  Third parties have claimed, and in the future may claim, infringement or\\nmisuse of intellectual property rights and/or breach of license agreement provisions.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We periodically receive notices from, or have lawsuits filed against us by, others claiming infringement or other misuse of their\\nintellectual property rights and/or breach of our agreements with them. These third parties include entities that do not have the capabilities to design, manufacture, or distribute products or services or that acquire intellectual property like\\npatents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims of infringement and misuse. We expect to continue to receive such claims as: \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we continue to acquire companies and expand into new businesses; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows; \\n \\xa0 32 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the use and support of third-party code (including open source code) becomes more prevalent in the industry; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the volume of issued patents continues to increase; and \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n non-practicing entities continue to assert intellectual property infringement in our industry segments. \\nResponding to any such claim, regardless of its validity, could:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n be time consuming, costly and result in litigation;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n divert management\\x92s time and attention from developing our business; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable;\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n require us to stop selling or to redesign certain of our products; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n require us to release source code to third parties, possibly under open source license terms; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n require us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers; or \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. \\nOur periodic workforce restructurings, including reorganizations of our sales force, can be disruptive.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We have in\\nthe past restructured or made other adjustments to our workforce, including our direct sales force on which we rely heavily, in response to management changes, product changes, performance issues, change in strategies, acquisitions and other\\ninternal and external considerations. In the past, these types of sales force restructurings have resulted in increased restructuring costs, increased sales and marketing costs and temporary reduced productivity while the sales teams adjusted to\\ntheir new roles and responsibilities. In addition, we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth or cost savings benefits of these restructurings, or do so within the expected timeframe. These effects could recur in connection with future\\nacquisitions and other restructurings and our revenues and other results of operations could be negatively affected.  We may lose key\\nemployees or may be unable to hire enough qualified employees.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We rely on hiring qualified employees and the continued service of our senior management, including our Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief\\nTechnology Officer and founder, our Chief Executive Officers, other members of our executive team and other key employees. In the technology industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business, product development,\\ntechnical and other personnel. We may also experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher sales. We may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing\\npersonnel. With rare exceptions, we do not have long-term employment or non-competition agreements with our employees. Members of our senior management team have left Oracle over the years for a variety of reasons, and we cannot assure you that\\nthere will not be additional departures, which may be disruptive to our operations.  We continually focus on improving our cost structure by\\nhiring personnel in countries where advanced technical expertise and other expertise are available at lower costs. When we make adjustments to our workforce, we may incur expenses associated with workforce reductions that delay the benefit of a more\\nefficient workforce structure. We may also experience increased competition for employees in these countries as the trend toward globalization continues, which may affect our employee retention efforts and increase our expenses in an effort to offer\\na competitive compensation program.  Our general compensation program includes restricted stock units, performance stock units and stock\\noptions, which are important tools in attracting and retaining employees in our industry. If our stock price performs poorly, it may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract employees. We continually evaluate our compensation practices and\\nconsider changes from time to time, such as reducing the number of employees granted equity awards or the number of equity awards granted per employee and granting alternative forms of stock-based compensation, which may have an impact on our\\nability to retain employees and the amount of stock-based compensation expense that we record. Any changes in our compensation practices or those of our competitors could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new\\npersonnel. \\n \\xa0 33 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Our sales to government clients expose us to business volatility and risks, including government\\nbudgeting cycles and appropriations, early termination, audits, investigations, sanctions and penalties.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We derive revenues from contracts with the U.S. government, state and local governments, and foreign governments\\nand their respective agencies, which may terminate most of these contracts at any time, without cause. There is increased pressure on governments and their agencies, both domestically and internationally, to reduce spending. Further, our U.S.\\nfederal government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations made by the U.S. Congress to fund the expenditures under these contracts. Similarly, our contracts with U.S. state and local governments, foreign governments and their\\nagencies are generally subject to government funding authorizations. Additionally, government contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations which could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions,\\nincluding termination of contracts, refund of a portion of fees received, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business. \\nWe may not receive significant revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years, if at\\nall.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Developing cloud, software and hardware offerings is expensive and the investment in the development of these offerings often involves a long return on investment cycle. An important element of our corporate\\nstrategy is to continue to make significant investments in research and development and related product and service opportunities both through internal investments and the acquisition of intellectual property from companies that we have acquired.\\nAccelerated product and service introductions and short software and hardware life cycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by revenue increases. We\\nbelieve that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. However, we do not expect to receive significant revenues from these investments for several\\nyears, if at all.  Business disruptions could adversely affect our operating results.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0A significant\\nportion of our critical business operations are concentrated in a few geographic areas. We are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems could cause delays in completing sales and providing services, including some of\\nour cloud offerings. A major earthquake, fire, other catastrophic event or the effects of climate change (such as increased storm severity, drought and pandemics) that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT\\nsystems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected.   Adverse litigation results could affect our business.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We are subject to various legal proceedings. Litigation can be lengthy, expensive and disruptive to our\\noperations, and can divert our management\\x92s attention away from running our core business. The results of our litigation also cannot be predicted with certainty. An adverse decision could result in monetary damages or injunctive relief that\\ncould affect our business, operating results or financial condition. Additional information regarding certain of the lawsuits we are involved in is discussed under Note\\xa018 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this\\nAnnual Report.   We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0As a multinational\\ncorporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in both the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We\\nare regularly under audit by tax authorities and those authorities often do not agree with positions taken by us on our tax returns.  Changes\\nin tax laws or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. For example, the U.S., many countries in the EU, and other countries where we do business, are actively considering or have enacted changes in relevant tax,\\naccounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. In particular, reforming the taxation of international businesses has been a priority for U.S. politicians, and key\\nmembers of the legislative and executive branches have proposed a wide variety of potential changes, any of which could have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. Further, in the ordinary course of a global business, there are many\\nintercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our intercompany transfer pricing has been and is currently being reviewed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and by foreign tax jurisdictions and\\nwill likely be subject to additional audits in the future. Although we have negotiated certain unilateral Advance Pricing Agreements with the IRS and certain selected bilateral Advance Pricing Agreements that cover some of\\n\\n \\xa0 34 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nour intercompany transfer pricing issues and preclude the relevant tax authorities from making a transfer pricing adjustment within the scope of these agreements, these agreements do not cover\\nsubstantial elements of our transfer pricing. In recent periods, transfer pricing audits in many foreign jurisdictions have become increasingly contentious. Similarly, certain jurisdictions are increasingly raising concerns about certain withholding\\ntax matters. In addition, our provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions which we consider to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. that have lower statutory tax rates and\\nearnings being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates.  We are also subject to non-income based taxes,\\nsuch as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities with respect to these non-income based taxes and may have\\nexposure to additional non-income based tax liabilities. Our acquisition activities have increased our non-income based tax exposures, particularly with our entry into the hardware business, which increased the volume and complexity of laws and\\nregulations that we are subject to and with which we must comply.  Although we believe that our income and non-income based tax estimates are\\nreasonable, there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Charges to earnings resulting from acquisitions may adversely affect our operating results.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Under business combination accounting standards pursuant to ASC 805,\\nBusiness Combinations, we recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interests in acquired companies generally at their acquisition date fair values and, in each case, separately from goodwill.\\nGoodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess amount of consideration transferred, which is also generally measured at fair value, and the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities\\nassumed. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain. After we complete an acquisition, the following factors could result in material charges and adversely affect our operating\\nresults and may adversely affect our cash flows:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n costs incurred to combine the operations of companies we acquire, such as transitional employee expenses and employee retention, redeployment or\\nrelocation expenses;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n impairment of goodwill or impairment of intangible assets, both asset types of which have increased due to our recent acquisitions and may continue to\\nincrease in the future;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n amortization of intangible assets acquired;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n a reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets acquired; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n identification of, or changes to, assumed contingent liabilities, both income tax and non-income tax related, after our final determination of the\\namounts for these contingencies or the conclusion of the measurement period (generally up to one year from the acquisition date), whichever comes first; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n charges to our operating results to maintain certain duplicative pre-merger activities for an extended period of time or to maintain these activities\\nfor a period of time that is longer than we had anticipated, charges to eliminate certain duplicative pre-merger activities, and charges to restructure our operations or to reduce our cost structure; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n charges to our operating results due to expenses incurred to effect the acquisition; and \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n charges to our operating results due to the expensing of certain stock awards assumed in an acquisition. \\nSubstantially all of these costs will be accounted for as expenses that will decrease our net income and earnings per share for the periods in which those\\ncosts are incurred. For example, we recognized a goodwill impairment loss in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 relating to our hardware reporting unit. Charges to our operating results in any given period could differ substantially from other\\nperiods based on the timing and size of our future acquisitions and the extent of integration activities. A more detailed discussion of our accounting for business combinations and other items is presented in the \\x93Critical Accounting Policies\\nand Estimates\\x94 section of Management\\x92s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 7). \\n \\xa0 35 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n There are risks associated with our outstanding and future\\nindebtedness.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0As of May\\xa031, 2017, we had an aggregate of $57.9 billion of outstanding indebtedness that will mature between calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2055 and we may incur additional\\nindebtedness in the future. Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations, generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt and the other factors discussed\\nin this section. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.   We may also need to\\nrefinance a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt. Furthermore, if prevailing\\ninterest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. Should we incur future increases in interest expense, our\\nability to utilize certain of our foreign tax credits to reduce our U.S. federal income tax could be limited, which could unfavorably affect our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. In addition, changes by any rating agency to our\\noutlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase the interest amounts we pay on certain outstanding or future debt. These risks could adversely affect our financial condition and results\\nof operations.  Environmental and other related laws and regulations subject us to a number of risks and could result in significant\\nliabilities and costs.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Some of our cloud and hardware operations are subject to state, federal and international laws governing protection of the environment, proper handling and disposal of materials used for these\\nproducts, human health and safety, the use of certain chemical substances and the labor practices of suppliers, as well as local testing and labelling requirements. We endeavor to comply with these environmental and other laws, yet compliance with\\nthese environmental and other laws could increase our product design, development, procurement, manufacturing, delivery, cloud operations and administration costs, limit our ability to manage excess and obsolete non-compliant inventory, change our\\nsales activities, or otherwise impact future financial results of our cloud and hardware businesses. Any violation of these laws can subject us to significant liability, including fines, penalties and possible prohibition of sales of our products\\nand services into one or more states or countries and result in a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our cloud and hardware businesses.  \\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted disclosure requirements for companies that use certain \\x93conflict minerals\\x94 (commonly\\nreferred to as tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold) in their products. Our supply chain is multi-tiered, global and highly complex. As a provider of hardware end products, we are several steps removed from the mining and smelting or refining of any\\nconflict minerals in our supply chain. Accordingly, our ability to determine with certainty the origin and chain of custody of conflict minerals is limited. Our relationships with customers and suppliers could suffer if we are unable to describe our\\nproducts as \\x93conflict-free.\\x94 We may also face increased costs in complying with conflict minerals disclosure requirements.  A\\nsignificant portion of our hardware revenues come from international sales. Environmental legislation, such as the EU Directive on Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS), the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE\\nDirective) and China\\x92s regulation on Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products, may increase our cost of doing business internationally and impact our hardware revenues from the EU, China and other\\ncountries with similar environmental legislation as we endeavor to comply with and implement these requirements. The cumulative impact of international environmental legislation could be significant. \\nOur stock price could become more volatile and your investment could lose value.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0All of the factors discussed in this\\nsection could affect our stock price. The timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products, product enhancements or technological advances by our competitors or us and any announcements by us of acquisitions, major transactions,\\nor management changes could also affect our stock price. Changes in the amounts and frequency of share repurchases or dividends could adversely affect our stock price. Our stock price is subject to speculation in the press and the analyst community,\\nchanges in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts, changes in investors\\x92 or analysts\\x92 valuation measures for our stock, our credit ratings and market trends unrelated to our performance. A significant drop in our stock\\nprice could also expose us to the risk of securities class action lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and divert management\\x92s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business. \\n \\xa0 36 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Item 1B.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Unresolved Staff Comments \\nNone.

In June 2017, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share of our outstanding\\ncommon stock payable on August\\xa02, 2017 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July\\xa019, 2017. We currently expect to continue paying comparable cash dividends on a quarterly basis; however, future declarations of dividends\\nand the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.  For equity\\ncompensation plan information, please refer to Item\\xa012 in Part III of this Annual Report.  Stock Repurchase Program\\n Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On March\\xa015, 2016, we announced\\nthat our Board of Directors approved an expansion of our stock repurchase program by an additional $10.0 billion. As of May\\xa031, 2017, approximately $5.3 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program.\\n Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our\\nworking capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to\\ntime through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.  The following table summarizes the stock repurchase activity for the three months ended May\\xa031, 2017 and the approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased pursuant to our stock\\nrepurchase program:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n (in millions, except per share amounts)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nTotal\\xa0Number\\xa0\\nofSharesPurchased\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nAverage\\xa0PricePaid\\xa0\\nperShare\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nTotal\\xa0Number\\xa0ofShares\\xa0\\nPurchased\\xa0asPart\\xa0of\\xa0PubliclyAnnouncedProgram\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nApproximate\\xa0DollarValue\\xa0\\nof\\xa0Shares\\xa0thatMay\\xa0Yet\\xa0BePurchasedUnder\\xa0the\\xa0Program\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n March\\xa01, 2017\\x97March 31, 2017\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n4.0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n43.90\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n4.0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n5,664.8\\n\\xa0\\n\\n April\\xa01, 2017\\x97April 30, 2017\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n3.3\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n44.49\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n3.3\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n5,518.6\\n\\xa0\\n\\n May\\xa01, 2017\\x97May 31, 2017\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n3.8\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n45.07\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n3.8\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n5,349.4\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Total\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n11.1\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n44.47\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n11.1\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xa0 38 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Stock Performance Graph and Cumulative Total Return \\nThe graph below compares the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock with the cumulative total return of the S&P 500 Index and the\\nS&P Information Technology Index for each of the last five fiscal years ended May\\xa031, 2017, assuming an investment of $100 at the beginning of such period and the reinvestment of any dividends.

The results of our acquired companies have been included in our consolidated financial statements since their respective dates of acquisition and have contributed to our revenues, income, earnings\\nper share and total assets.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nAs of and for the Year Ended May\\xa031,\\n\\xa0\\n\\n (in millions, except per share amounts)\\n\\xa0\\n2017\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2016(1)\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2015\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2014\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2013\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Consolidated Statements of Operations Data:\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Total revenues\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n37,728\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n37,047\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n38,226\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n38,275\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n37,180\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Operating income\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n12,710\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n12,604\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n13,871\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n14,759\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n14,684\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Net income\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n9,335\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n8,901\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n9,938\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n10,955\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n10,925\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Earnings per share\\x97diluted\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n2.21\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n2.07\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n2.21\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n2.38\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n2.26\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n4,217\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n4,305\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n4,503\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n4,604\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n4,844\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Cash dividends declared per common share\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n0.64\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n0.60\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n0.51\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n0.48\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n0.30\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Consolidated Balance Sheets Data:\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Working capital(2)\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n50,337\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n47,105\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n47,314\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n32,954\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n27,950\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Total assets(2)\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0134,991\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0112,180\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0110,903\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa090,266\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa081,745\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Notes payable and other borrowings(3)\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n57,909\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n43,855\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n41,958\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n24,097\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n18,427\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n(1)\\xa0\\n Our results of operations for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 were significantly impacted by movements in international currencies relative to the\\nU.S.\\xa0Dollar, which decreased our fiscal 2016 total revenues by 5 percentage points and total operating income by 7\\xa0percentage points in comparison to the corresponding prior year period. \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n(2)\\xa0\\n Total working capital and total assets sequentially increased in nearly all periods presented primarily due to the favorable impacts to our net current\\nassets resulting from our net income generated during all periods presented and the issuances of long-term senior notes of $14.0 billion in fiscal 2017, $20.0 billion in fiscal 2015, \\x802.0 billion and $3.0 billion in fiscal 2014 and $5.0 billion\\nin fiscal 2013. Our total assets were also favorably impacted by the issuance of $3.8 billion of short-term borrowings in both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016. These increases were partially offset by cash used for acquisitions, repurchases of our\\ncommon stock and dividend payments made in all periods presented, repayments of certain of our senior notes in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2013, and the repayment of $3.8 billion of short-term borrowings in fiscal 2017. In fiscal 2016, we adopted\\nAccounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes on a retrospective basis. Pursuant to the new accounting standard, all deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as\\nnon-current in our consolidated balance sheets and the working capital amounts presented above for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 have been recast accordingly. \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n(3)\\xa0\\n Our notes payable and other borrowings, which represented the summation of our notes payable and other borrowings, current, and notes payable and other\\nborrowings, non-current, as reported per our consolidated balance sheets as of the dates listed in the table above, increased between fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2017 primarily due to the fiscal 2017 issuance of long-term senior notes of $14.0 billion\\nand short-term borrowings of $3.8 billion, the fiscal 2016 issuance of $3.8 billion of short-term borrowings, and the issuances of long-term senior notes of $20.0 billion in fiscal 2015, \\x802.0 billion and $3.0 billion in fiscal 2014, and $5.0\\nbillion in fiscal 2013. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our notes payable and other borrowings. \\n \\xa0 40 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Item\\xa07.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Management\\x92s Discussion and Analysis\\nof Financial Condition and Results of Operations  We begin Management\\x92s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\\nOperations with an overview of our businesses and significant trends. This overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated\\nin our reported financial results. We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition.  Business\\nOverview  Oracle Corporation provides products and services that address all aspects of corporate information technology (IT)\\nenvironments\\x97applications, platform and infrastructure. Our products are delivered to over 400,000\\xa0worldwide customers through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models including on-premise, cloud-based or hybrid that\\nenable customer choice and best meet customer IT needs.  Our Oracle Cloud offerings provide a comprehensive and fully integrated stack of\\napplications, platform, compute, storage and networking services in all three primary layers of the cloud: Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Our on-premise IT offerings include Oracle\\nApplications, Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware software, among others; hardware products including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage and industry-specific products, among others; and related support and services. We provide our\\ncloud and on-premise offerings to businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers with a sales force positioned to offer the combinations that best suit customer needs. \\nOur comprehensive and fully integrated stack of Oracle Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings integrate the software, hardware and services on the\\ncustomers\\x92 behalf in IT environments that we deploy, support and manage for the customer. Our integrated Oracle Cloud offerings are designed to be rapidly deployable to enable customers shorter time to innovation; easily maintainable to reduce\\nintegration and testing work; connectable among differing deployment models to enable interchangeability and extendibility between cloud and on-premise IT environments; compatible to easily move workloads between on-premise IT environments and the\\nOracle Cloud; cost-effective by requiring lower upfront customer investment; and secure, standards-based and reliable. We are a leader in the core technologies of cloud IT environments, including database and middleware software as well as\\nenterprise applications, virtualization, clustering, large-scale systems management and related infrastructure. Our products and services are the building blocks of our Oracle Cloud services, our partners\\x92 cloud services and our customers\\x92\\ncloud IT environments.  In addition to providing a broad spectrum of cloud offerings, we develop and sell our applications, platform and\\ninfrastructure products and services to our customers worldwide for use in their global data centers and on-premise IT environments. An important element of our corporate strategy is to continue our investments in, and innovation with respect to,\\nour products and services that we offer through our cloud and on-premise software, hardware and services businesses. We have a deep understanding as to how applications, platform and infrastructure technologies interact and function with one another\\nwithin IT environments. We focus our development efforts on improving the performance, security, operation and integration of these differing technologies to make them more cost-effective and easier to deploy, manage and maintain for our customers\\nand to improve their computing performance relative to our competitors. After the initial purchase of Oracle products and services, our customers can continue to benefit from our research and development efforts and deep IT expertise by purchasing\\nand renewing Oracle support offerings for their on-premise deployments, which may include product enhancements that we periodically deliver to our products, and/or by renewing their SaaS, PaaS and IaaS contracts with us. \\nAs customers deploy with the Oracle Cloud, many are adopting a hybrid IT model whereby certain of their IT\\xa0instances are deployed using the Oracle\\nCloud, while other of their IT instances are deployed using Oracle on-premise offerings, and both instances are designed with capabilities to be manageable as one. Our Oracle Cloud at Customer program provides\\nanother deployment option that utilizes the Oracle Cloud Machine and Oracle Database Exadata Cloud Machine to bring certain Oracle Cloud PaaS and IaaS offerings to a customer\\x92s on-premise IT environment to meet data sovereignty, data residency,\\ndata protection and regulatory business policy requirements, among others, while benefiting from many advantages of a cloud service. \\n \\xa0 41 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n A selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. We\\nbelieve that our acquisitions enhance the products and services that we can offer to customers, expand our customer base, provide greater scale to accelerate innovation, grow our revenues and earnings, and increase stockholder value. In recent\\nyears, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of companies, products, services and technologies that add to, are complementary to, or have otherwise enhanced our existing offerings. On November\\xa07, 2016, we acquired NetSuite\\nInc. (NetSuite). Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, provides additional information related to our acquisition of NetSuite. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services\\nand technologies to further our corporate strategy.  In recent periods, customer demand has increased at a greater rate for cloud-based IT\\ndeployment models relative to on-premise IT deployment models. To address this demand, we have increased our investment in and focus on the development, marketing and sale of our cloud-based applications, platform and infrastructure technologies\\nresulting in higher growth of our SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues as customer preferences have pivoted to the Oracle Cloud for new deployments and as customers migrate to and expand with the Oracle Cloud for their existing on-premise workloads. We\\nexpect these trends to continue. We believe that offering customers broad, comprehensive, flexible and interoperable deployment models for our applications, platform and infrastructure technologies is important to our growth strategy and better\\naddresses customer needs relative to our competitors, many of whom provide fewer offerings and more restrictive deployment models. We enable customers to evolve and transform to substantially any IT deployment model at whatever pace is most\\nappropriate for them.  We have three businesses: cloud and on-premise software, hardware and services, each of which comprises a single\\noperating segment. Our chief operating decision makers (CODMs), which include our Chief Executive Officers and Chief Technology Officer, view the operating results of our three businesses and allocate resources in a manner that is consistent with\\nthe changing market dynamics that we have experienced in recent periods. As a result, during fiscal 2017, we updated our operating segments. The discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations presented below provides the\\ncurrent view that is utilized by our CODMs to evaluate performance and determine resource allocations. In addition to the discussion below, Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, provides\\nadditional information related to our businesses and operating segments, including the recasting of our segments\\x92 financial information from prior periods to conform to the current year\\x92s presentation. \\nCloud and On-Premise Software Business  Our cloud and on-premise software line of business markets, sells and delivers a broad spectrum of applications, platform and infrastructure technologies through our cloud and on-premise software\\nofferings. Our cloud and on-premise software revenues represented 80%, 78% and 77% of our total revenues in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Our Oracle Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings deliver applications, platform and infrastructure technologies via cloud-based deployment models that we host, manage and support and that customers access\\nby entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period. Our IaaS offerings also include Oracle Managed Cloud Services, which are designed to provide comprehensive software and hardware management, maintenance and security services for\\non-premise, cloud-based, or hybrid IT infrastructure for a stated period. Our SaaS, PaaS and IaaS arrangements are generally one to three years in duration and we strive to renew these contracts when they are eligible for renewal. \\nWe offer customers the ability to license our software products including Oracle Applications, Oracle Database, Oracle Fusion Middleware and Java, among\\nothers, for on-premise and other IT environments. Our new software license transactions are generally perpetual in nature and the timing of a few large software license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly new software licenses\\nrevenues, which is different than the typical revenue recognition for our cloud-based offerings for which revenues are generally recognized on a ratable basis over the subscription period. New software license customers have the option to purchase\\nsoftware license updates and product support contracts, which grant rights to unspecified product upgrades and maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period, as well as technical support assistance. Our software\\n\\n \\xa0 42 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nlicense updates and product support contracts are generally one year in duration and are generally billed in advance of the service being performed. \\nOur cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues and new software licenses revenues are affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions,\\ngovernmental budgetary constraints, the strategy for and competitive position of our offerings, our acquisitions, our ability to deliver and renew our cloud contracts with our existing customers and foreign currency rate fluctuations. In recent\\nperiods, we have placed significant strategic emphasis on growing our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues, which represented 12%, 8% and 6% of our total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This emphasis has affected the\\ngrowth of our new software licenses revenues, and to a lesser extent, has also affected the growth of our software license updates and product support revenues. We expect these trends will continue with the mix of revenues continuing to shift toward\\ncloud-based services for this business.  Our software license updates and product support revenues growth is primarily influenced by four\\nfactors: (1)\\xa0the percentage of our software support contract customer base that renews its software support contracts; (2)\\xa0the pricing of new software support contracts sold in connection with the sale of new software licenses;\\n(3)\\xa0the pricing of new software licenses sold; and (4)\\xa0the amount of software support contracts assumed from companies we have acquired. Substantially all of our customers purchase software license updates and product support contracts\\nwhen they acquire on-premise new software licenses and renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually in order to benefit from Oracle\\x92s research and development investments that are utilized as a part of periodic\\nsoftware updates that are released and that customers with current software support contracts are entitled to.  On a constant currency basis,\\nwe expect that our total cloud and on-premise software revenues generally will continue to increase due to:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n expected growth in our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n continued demand for our on-premise software products and software license updates and product support offerings, including the high percentage of\\ncustomers that renew their software license updates and product support contracts; and  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n contributions from our acquisitions.  We believe all of these factors should contribute to growing our cloud and on-premise software revenues, which should enable us to continue to make investments in research and development. \\nOur cloud and on-premise software business\\x92 segment margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular\\nfiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our new software licenses revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this business are generally fixed in the short term. \\nHardware Business  Our\\nhardware business represented 11%, 13% and 14% of our total revenues in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our hardware business provides a broad selection of hardware products and hardware-related software products including Oracle\\nEngineered Systems, servers, storage, industry-specific hardware, virtualization software, operating systems, management software and related hardware services including hardware support. We expect to make investments in research and development to\\nimprove existing hardware products and services and to develop new hardware products and services. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels, including independent distributors and value-added resellers. Our hardware\\nsupport offerings provide customers with software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products, such as Oracle Solaris and certain other software products, and can include product repairs,\\nmaintenance services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees.  We generally expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our cloud and on-premise software business due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and\\ndistribute these products and to provide support services, including direct materials and labor costs. \\n \\xa0 43 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Our quarterly hardware revenues are difficult to predict. Our hardware revenues, cost of hardware and\\nhardware operating margins that we report are affected by: our ability to timely manufacture or deliver a few large hardware transactions; our strategy for and the competitive position of our hardware products; the strength of general economic and\\nbusiness conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; whether customers decide to purchase hardware support contracts at or in close proximity to the time of hardware product sale; the percentage of our hardware support contract customer base\\nthat renews its support contracts and the close association between hardware products, which have a finite life, and customer demand for related hardware support as hardware products age; customer decisions to either maintain or upgrade their\\nexisting hardware infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available; certain of our acquisitions; and foreign currency rate fluctuations.  Services Business  Our services business helps customers and partners\\nmaximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications, platform and infrastructure technologies. We believe that our services are differentiated based on our focus on Oracle technologies, extensive experience and broad sets of\\nintellectual property and best practices. Our services offerings include consulting services, advanced support services and education services and represented 9% of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015. Our services business has\\nlower segment margins than our cloud and on-premise software and hardware businesses. Our services revenues are impacted by our strategy for and the competitive position of our services, certain of our acquisitions, general economic conditions,\\ngovernmental budgetary constraints, personnel reductions in our customers\\x92 IT departments, tighter controls over discretionary spending, our strategic emphasis on growing our cloud revenues, and customer demand for our cloud and on-premise\\nsoftware and hardware offerings.  Acquisitions  Our selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies,\\nproducts, services and technologies, including NetSuite in fiscal 2017 and MICROS in fiscal 2015.  We expect to continue to acquire companies,\\nproducts, services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy. Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provides additional information related to our recent acquisitions.\\n We believe that we can fund our future acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash\\ngenerated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flow and return on invested capital targets\\nbefore deciding to move forward with an acquisition.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates \\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the Financial\\nAccounting Standards Board\\x92s (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), and we consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. GAAP, as set forth within\\nthe ASC, requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments\\nand assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods\\npresented. To the extent that there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and\\nassumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Revenue Recognition;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Business Combinations; \\n \\xa0 44 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Goodwill and Intangible Assets\\x97Impairment Assessments; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Accounting for Income Taxes; and  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Legal and Other Contingencies.  In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management\\x92s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which\\nmanagement\\x92s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. Our senior management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of\\nthe Board of Directors.  Revenue Recognition  Our sources of revenues include:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n cloud and on-premise software revenues, which include the sale of: cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, which generally grant customers access to a\\nbroad range of our applications, platform and infrastructure technologies and related support and services offerings on a subscription basis in a secure, standards-based cloud computing environment; new software licenses, which generally grant to\\ncustomers a perpetual right to use our database, middleware, applications and industry-specific software products; and software license updates and product support offerings (described further below); \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n hardware revenues, which include the sale of hardware products including Oracle Engineered Systems, computer servers, and storage products, and\\nindustry-specific hardware; and hardware support revenues (described further below); and  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n services revenues, which are earned from providing cloud, software and hardware related services including consulting, advanced customer support and\\neducation services.  Revenues generally are recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to\\ngovernmental authorities.  Revenue Recognition for Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS Offerings, Hardware Products, Hardware Support and Related\\nServices (Non-software Elements)  Our revenue recognition policy for non-software deliverables including cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS\\nofferings, hardware products, hardware support and related services is based upon the accounting guidance contained in ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition, Multiple-Element Arrangements, and we exercise judgment and use estimates in\\nconnection with the determination of the amount of cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues, hardware products revenues, hardware support and related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period. \\nRevenues from the sales of our non-software elements are recognized when: (1)\\xa0persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2)\\xa0we deliver the\\nproducts and passage of the title to the buyer occurs; (3)\\xa0the sale price is fixed or determinable; and (4)\\xa0collection is reasonably assured. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met\\nare recognized when those conditions are subsequently met.  Our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings generally provide customers access to\\ncertain of our software and/or infrastructure within a cloud-based IT environment that we manage, host and support and offer to customers on a subscription basis. Our cloud IaaS offerings also include deployment and management services for software\\nand hardware related IT infrastructure. Revenues for our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings are generally recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date the service is made available to customers and all other revenue\\nrecognition criteria have been satisfied.  Revenues from the sale of hardware products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of our\\nOracle Engineered Systems, computer servers, storage, and industry-specific hardware and are recognized upon the delivery of the hardware product to the customer provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. \\n \\xa0 45 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Our hardware support offerings generally provide customers with software updates for the software components\\nthat are essential to the functionality of our hardware products and can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products\\nfees. Hardware support contracts are entered into at the customer\\x92s option and are recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangements, which is typically one year, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been\\nsatisfied.  Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements\\x97Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS Offerings, Hardware Products, Hardware\\nSupport and Related Services (Non-software Arrangements)  We enter into arrangements with customers that purchase non-software related\\nproducts and services from us at the same time, or within close proximity of one another (referred to as non-software multiple-element arrangements). Each element within a non-software multiple-element arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit\\nof accounting provided the following criteria are met: the delivered products or services have value to the customer on a standalone basis; and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered products or\\nservices, delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service is considered probable and is substantially controlled by us. We consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by us or another\\nvendor or could be resold by the customer. Further, our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products. Where the aforementioned criteria for a separate unit of accounting are not met, the\\ndeliverable is combined with the undelivered element(s) and treated as a single unit of accounting for the purposes of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition. For those units of accounting that include more than one\\ndeliverable but are treated as a single unit of accounting, we generally recognize revenues over the contractual period of the arrangement, or in the case of our cloud offerings, we generally recognize revenues over the contractual term of the cloud\\nsoftware subscription. For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we allocate revenue to the respective revenue line items within our consolidated statements of operations based\\non a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of relative selling prices of such elements.  For our non-software\\nmultiple-element arrangements, we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangement\\x92s inception. The selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy: VSOE if available,\\nthird-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE are available (a description as to how we determine VSOE, TPE and ESP is provided below). If a tangible hardware product includes software,\\nwe determine whether the tangible hardware product and the software work together to deliver the product\\x92s essential functionality and, if so, the entire product is treated as a non-software deliverable. The total arrangement consideration is\\nallocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the non-software deliverables using the relative selling prices of each unit based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. We limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered\\nelements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional products or services or meeting of any specified performance conditions.  When possible, we establish VSOE of selling price for deliverables in software and non-software multiple-element arrangements using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and for\\nsoftware license updates and product support and hardware support, based on the renewal rates offered to customers. TPE is established by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with\\nsimilarly situated customers. If we are unable to determine the selling price because VSOE or TPE does not exist, we determine ESP for the purposes of allocating the arrangement by reviewing historical transactions, including transactions whereby\\nthe deliverable was sold on a standalone basis and considering several other external and internal factors including, but not limited to, pricing practices including discounting, margin objectives, competition, contractually stated prices, the\\ngeographies in which we offer our products and services, the type of customer (i.e., distributor, value-added reseller, government agency and direct end user, among others) and the stage of the product lifecycle. The determination of ESP is made\\nthrough consultation with and approval by our management, taking into consideration our pricing model and go-to-market strategy. As our, or our competitors\\x92, pricing and go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the\\nfuture, \\n \\xa0 46 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nwhich could result in changes to our determination of VSOE, TPE and ESP. As a result, our future revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements could differ materially from our results in\\nthe current period. Selling prices are analyzed on an annual basis or more frequently if we experience significant changes in our selling prices.  Revenue Recognition for Software Products and Software Related Services (Software Elements) \\nNew software licenses revenues primarily represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database, middleware, applications and\\nindustry-specific software products and exclude cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues and revenues derived from software license updates, which are included in software license updates and product support revenues. The basis for our new software\\nlicenses revenue recognition is substantially governed by the accounting guidance contained in ASC 985-605, Software-Revenue Recognition. We exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software\\nand software related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period.  For software license arrangements that do not require\\nsignificant modification or customization of the underlying software, we recognize new software licenses revenues when: (1)\\xa0we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software; (2)\\xa0we deliver the\\nproducts; (3)\\xa0the sale price is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties; and (4)\\xa0collection is probable. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not\\nmet, are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met.  Substantially all of our software license arrangements do not include\\nacceptance provisions. However, if acceptance provisions exist as part of public policy (for example, in agreements with government entities where acceptance periods are required by law, or within previously executed terms and conditions that are\\nreferenced in the current agreement and are short-term in nature), we generally recognize revenues upon delivery provided the acceptance terms are perfunctory and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. If acceptance provisions are not\\nperfunctory (for example, acceptance provisions that are long-term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement), revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance\\nperiod.  The vast majority of our software license arrangements include software license updates and product support contracts, which are\\nentered into at the customer\\x92s option, and the related fees are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement, typically one year. Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades,\\nmaintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period. Product support includes internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel. Software license updates and\\nproduct support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net new software licenses fees and are generally invoiced in full at the beginning of the support term. Substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and\\nproduct support contracts annually.  Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements\\x97Software Products, Software Support\\nand Software Related Services (Software Arrangements)  We often enter into arrangements with customers that purchase software related\\nproducts, software support and software related services from us at the same time, or within close proximity of one another (referred to as software related multiple-element arrangements). Such software related multiple-element arrangements include\\nthe sale of our software products, software license updates and product support contracts and other software related services whereby software license delivery is followed by the subsequent or contemporaneous delivery of the other elements. For\\nthose software related multiple-element arrangements, we have applied the residual method to determine the amount of new software license revenues to be recognized pursuant to ASC 985-605. Under the residual method, if fair value exists for\\nundelivered elements in a multiple-element arrangement, such fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred with the remaining portion of the arrangement consideration generally recognized upon delivery of the software license. We allocate the\\nfair value of each element of a software related multiple-element arrangement based upon its fair value as determined by our vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE\\x97described further above), with any remaining amount allocated to the software\\nlicense. \\n \\xa0 47 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to both Software and Non-software Elements \\nRevenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements\\x97Arrangements with Software and Non-software Elements \\nWe also enter into multiple-element arrangements that may include a combination of our various software related and non-software related products and\\nservices offerings including new software licenses, software license updates and product support, cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, hardware products, hardware support, consulting, advanced customer support services and education. In such\\narrangements, we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative selling prices of the software group of elements as a whole and to the non-software elements. We then further allocate consideration within the software group\\nto the respective elements within that group following the guidance in ASC 985-605 and our policies as described above. In addition, we allocate the consideration within the non-software group to each respective element within that group based on a\\nselling price hierarchy at the arrangement\\x92s inception as described above. After the arrangement consideration has been allocated to the software group of elements and non-software group of elements, we account for each respective element in\\nthe arrangement as described above and below.  Other Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to Software and Non-software Elements\\n Many of our software arrangements include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts and are\\nincluded as a part of our services business. Consulting revenues from these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from new software licenses revenues because the arrangements qualify as services transactions as defined in ASC 985-605.\\nThe more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenues should be accounted for separately include the nature of services (i.e., consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product),\\ndegree of risk, availability of services from other vendors, timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee. Revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the\\nservices are performed. If there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services, revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved. We estimate the proportional\\nperformance on contracts with fixed or \\x93not to exceed\\x94 fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project. If we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress\\ntowards completion, revenues are recognized when we receive final acceptance from the customer that the services have been completed. When total cost estimates exceed revenues, we accrue for the estimated losses immediately using cost estimates that\\nare based upon an average fully burdened daily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the services. The complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the\\napplication of the proportional performance method of accounting affects the amounts of revenues and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements. A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates, including\\nlabor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes.  Our advanced customer support services\\nare offered as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying other software and non-software products and services. We offer these advanced support services, both on-premise and remote, to Oracle customers to enable\\nincreased performance and higher availability of their products and services. Depending upon the nature of the arrangement, revenues from these services are recognized as the services are performed or ratably over the term of the service period,\\nwhich is generally one year or less.  Education revenues are also a part of our services business and include instructor-led, media-based and\\ninternet-based training in the use of our cloud, software and hardware products. Education revenues are recognized as the classes or other education offerings are delivered.  If an arrangement contains multiple elements and does not qualify for separate accounting for the product and service transactions, then new software licenses revenues and/or hardware products revenues,\\nincluding the costs of hardware products, are generally recognized together with the services based on contract accounting using either the percentage-of-completion or completed-contract method. \\n \\xa0 48 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n We also evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing \\x93fiscal funding\\x94 or\\n\\x93termination for convenience\\x94 provisions, when such provisions are required by law, to determine the probability of possible cancellation. We consider multiple factors, including the history with the customer in similar transactions, the\\n\\x93essential use\\x94 of the software or hardware products and the planning, budgeting and approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity. If we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is\\nremote, we then recognize revenues once all of the criteria described above have been met. If such a determination cannot be made, revenues are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the\\ngovernmental entity.  We assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenues if all other revenue\\nrecognition requirements are met. Our standard payment terms are net 30 days. However, payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed. We evaluate non-standard payment terms based on whether we have successful\\ncollection history on comparable arrangements (based upon similarity of customers, products, and license economics) and, if so, generally conclude such payment terms are fixed and determinable and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue\\nrecognition.  While most of our arrangements for sales within our businesses include short-term payment terms, we have a standard practice of\\nproviding long-term financing to creditworthy customers primarily through our financing division. Since fiscal 1989, when our financing division was formed, we have established a history of collection, without concessions, on these receivables with\\npayment terms that generally extend up to five years from the contract date. Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, we recognize new software licenses revenues and hardware products revenues for these arrangements upon\\ndelivery, net of any payment discounts from financing transactions. We have generally sold receivables financed through our financing division on a non-recourse basis to third-party financing institutions within 90 days of the contracts\\x92 dates\\nof execution and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We account for the sales of these receivables as \\x93true sales\\x94 as defined in ASC 860,\\nTransfers and Servicing, as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables.  Our customers include several\\nof our suppliers and, occasionally, we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendors at or about the same time that we have sold our products to these same companies (Concurrent Transactions). Software license agreements,\\nsales of hardware or sales of services that occur within a three-month time period from the date we have purchased goods or services from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure. When we acquire goods or\\nservices from a customer, we negotiate the purchase separately from any sales transaction, at terms we consider to be at arm\\x92s length and settle the purchase in cash. We recognize revenues from Concurrent Transactions if all of our revenue\\nrecognition criteria are met and the goods and services acquired are necessary for our current operations.  Business Combinations\\n We apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, in accounting for our acquisitions. It requires us to recognize\\nseparately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values\\nof the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration, where applicable, our\\nestimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the\\ncorresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated\\nstatements of operations.  Accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions,\\nespecially at the acquisition date, including our estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, pre-acquisition contingencies and any contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe that the assumptions and\\nestimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part \\n \\xa0 49 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\non historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.  Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include but are not limited to:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n future expected cash flows from assumed cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS contracts, software support contracts and hardware support contracts for which our\\nfuture expected cash flow estimates include estimated cash flow amounts and time periods over which such cash flows are expected to be received, estimated retention and renewal rates of existing customer contracts assumed as a part of the\\nacquisition, and estimated costs to sell, market, deliver and support such assumed contracts, among other estimates;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n future expected cash flows from acquired developed technology including estimated amounts to be received for such developed technology and the time\\nperiod over which such cash flows are expected to be received, among other estimates; and  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n discount rates. \\nUnanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. \\nWe estimate the fair values of our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, software license updates and product support, and hardware support obligations assumed as\\npart of an acquisition. The estimated fair values of these performance obligations are determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling these assumed\\nobligations plus a normal profit margin. The estimated costs to fulfill the assumed obligations are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services including the correction of any errors in the products acquired. The sum of\\nthese costs and operating profit approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the performance obligations. We do not include any costs associated with selling efforts or research and development or the\\nrelated fulfillment margins on these costs. Profit associated with any selling efforts is excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded those selling efforts on the performance obligations prior to the acquisition date. We also do not\\ninclude the estimated research and development costs in our fair value determinations, as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition. As a result of our fair value estimates for these obligations, we did\\nnot recognize certain cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, software license updates and product support and hardware support revenue amounts that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities upon delivery of the\\ncontractual obligations (refer to \\x93Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges\\x94 below for further discussion). Historically, substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software\\nlicense updates and product support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal, and we strive to renew cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS contracts and hardware support contracts when they are eligible for renewal. To the extent customers to which\\nthese contractual obligations pertain renew these contracts with us, we expect to recognize revenues for the full contracts\\x92 values over the respective contracts\\x92 renewal periods.  In connection with a business combination or other strategic initiative, we may estimate costs associated with restructuring plans committed to by our management. Restructuring costs are typically\\ncomprised of employee severance costs, costs of consolidating duplicate facilities and contract termination costs. Restructuring expenses are based upon plans that have been committed to by our management, but may be refined in subsequent periods.\\nWe account for costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company separately from the business combination pursuant to ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations. A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal\\nactivity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred. When estimating the fair value of facility restructuring activities, assumptions are applied\\nregarding estimated sub-lease payments to be received, which can differ materially from actual results. This may require us to revise our initial estimates which may materially affect our results of operations and financial position in the period\\nthe revision is made.  For a given acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend\\nour review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in \\n \\xa0 50 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\norder to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine\\ntheir estimated amounts.  If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a pre-acquisition contingency (non-income tax related) by the end\\nof the measurement period, which is generally the case given the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (1)\\xa0it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been\\nincurred at the acquisition date and (2)\\xa0the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent to the measurement period, changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material\\neffect on our results of operations and financial position.  In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed\\nin connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary\\nestimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance\\x92s or contingency\\x92s estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to\\nthese uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\\n Goodwill and Intangible Assets\\x97Impairment Assessments  We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles\\x97Goodwill and\\nOther. According to ASC 350, we can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting unit\\x92s goodwill for impairment or we can directly perform the two-step impairment test. Based on our qualitative assessment, if we determine\\nthat the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) to be less than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test prescribed by ASC 350 will be performed. In the first step, we compare the\\nfair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further\\ntesting. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting\\nunit\\x92s goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit\\x92s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference.  Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to\\ncalculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions and the determination of appropriate market comparables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions which we believe to be reasonable but\\nthat are inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting\\nunits.  We completed the required annual testing of goodwill for impairment as of March\\xa01, 2017 prior to our operating segment changes. We\\nalso subsequently performed a goodwill impairment test after such changes had been effected. Our most recent annual goodwill impairment analyses did not result in any goodwill impairment charges, nor did we recognize any impairment charges in fiscal\\n2016. In fiscal 2015, we recognized an impairment charge of $186 million related to our hardware business. All of our reporting units had fair values that substantially exceeded their carrying values based on our most recent annual goodwill\\nimpairment review.  We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in\\ncircumstances indicate that impairment may exist. Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization.\\nRecoverability of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any\\nimpairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. \\n \\xa0 51 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are\\ncomplex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Although we believe that\\nthe historical assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results. We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal\\n2017, 2016 or 2015.  Accounting for Income Taxes  Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome\\nis uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities, the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment and\\nsegregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical\\nincome tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made.  Our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the\\nUnited States. Remittances of foreign earnings to the United States are planned based on projected cash flow, working capital and investment needs of our foreign and domestic operations. Based on these assumptions, we estimate the amount that will\\nbe distributed to the United States and provide U.S. federal taxes on these amounts. Material changes in our estimates as to how much of our foreign earnings will be distributed to the United States or tax legislation that limits or restricts the\\namount of undistributed foreign earnings that we consider indefinitely reinvested outside the United States could materially impact our income tax provision and effective tax rate.  We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate\\nsufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We consider future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings,\\ntaxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or\\npart of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination, or goodwill would be adjusted at our final\\ndetermination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period. If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of\\nthe previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to earnings at such time.  We record deferred tax assets for stock-based\\ncompensation awards that result in deductions on certain of our income tax returns based on the amount of stock-based compensation recognized and the fair values attributable to the vested portion of stock awards assumed in connection with a\\nbusiness combination at the statutory tax rates in the jurisdictions that we are able to recognize such tax deductions. Beginning in fiscal 2017 (refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report\\nfor additional information regarding our fiscal 2017 adoption of ASU 2016-09, Compensation\\x97Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting), the impacts of the actual tax deductions for stock-based\\nawards that are realized in these jurisdictions are generally recognized to our consolidated statements of operations in the period that a restricted stock-based award vests or a stock option is exercised with any shortfall/windfall relative to the\\ndeferred tax asset established recorded as a discrete detriment/benefit to our provision for income taxes in this period. Such detriment/benefit can materially impact our reported effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 and prospective periods.\\n We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in\\nincome tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed \\n \\xa0 52 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nreturns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known, which can materially impact our effective tax rate. \\nThe amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments.\\nOur estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. A description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under \\x93Business\\nCombinations\\x94 above. For those tax related contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we account for these uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740, Income Taxes, which contains a two-step approach to recognizing and\\nmeasuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit,\\nincluding resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although we believe that we have\\nadequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a\\ntax audit, judicial rulings, and refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences\\ngenerally will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made. Our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also\\ninclude the related interest and penalties.  In addition, as a part of our accounting for business combinations, intangible assets are\\nrecognized at fair values and goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net estimated fair values of assets acquired. Impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an\\nincreased effective income tax rate in the period that any impairment is recorded. Amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible pursuant to our existing tax structure; however, deferred taxes have\\nbeen recorded for non-deductible amortization expenses as a part of the accounting for business combinations. We have taken into account the allocation of these identified intangibles among different taxing jurisdictions, including those with\\nnominal or zero percent tax rates, in establishing the related deferred tax liabilities.  Legal and Other Contingencies\\n We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and\\nassess our potential financial exposure. A description of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under \\x93Business Combinations\\x94 above. For legal and other contingencies\\nthat are not a part of a business combination, we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required\\nin both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time\\nthe accruals are made. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could\\nhave a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.  Results of Operations \\nImpacts of Acquisitions  The\\ncomparability of our operating results in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 and in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was impacted by our recent acquisitions. In our discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2017 compared to\\nfiscal 2016 and fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, we may qualitatively disclose the impact of our acquired products and services (for the one-year period subsequent to the acquisition date) to the growth in certain of our businesses\\x92\\nrevenues where such qualitative discussions would be meaningful for an understanding of the factors that influenced the changes in our results of operations. When material, we may also \\n \\xa0 53 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nprovide quantitative disclosures related to such acquired products and services. Expense contributions from our recent acquisitions for each of the respective period comparisons may not be\\nseparately identifiable due to the integration of these businesses into our existing operations, and/or were insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented.  We caution readers that, while pre- and post-acquisition comparisons, as well as any quantified amounts themselves, may provide indications of general trends, any acquisition information that we provide\\nhas inherent limitations for the following reasons:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n any qualitative and quantitative disclosures cannot specifically address or quantify the substantial effects attributable to changes in business\\nstrategies, including our sales force integration efforts. We believe that if our acquired companies had operated independently and sales forces had not been integrated, the relative mix of products and services sold would have been different; and\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n although substantially all of our on-premise software license customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software license\\nupdates and product support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal, and we strive to renew cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS contracts and hardware support contracts, the amounts shown as cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS deferred revenues, software\\nlicense updates and product support deferred revenues, and hardware support deferred revenues in our \\x93Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges\\x94 (presented below) are not necessarily indicative of revenue improvements we will\\nachieve upon contract renewals to the extent customers do not renew.  Presentation of Operating Segments and Other\\nFinancial Information  In our results of operations discussion below, we provide an overview of our total consolidated revenues, total\\nconsolidated expenses and total consolidated operating margin, all of which are presented on a GAAP basis. We also present a GAAP based discussion for substantially all of the other expense items described below that are not directly attributable to\\nour operating segments.  In addition, we discuss below the results of each our three businesses\\x97cloud and on-premise software, hardware\\nand services\\x97which also are our operating segments as defined pursuant to ASC 280, Segment Reporting. The financial reporting for our three operating segments that is presented in the results of operations discussion below is presented\\nin a manner that is consistent with that used by our CODMs. Our operating segment presentation below reflects revenues, direct costs and sales and marketing expenses that correspond to and are directly attributable to each of our three operating\\nsegments. We also utilize these inputs to calculate and present a segment margin for each operating segment in the discussion below. \\nConsistent with our internal management reporting processes, the below operating segment presentation includes revenues related to cloud and on-premise\\nsoftware and hardware contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities but were not recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented due to business combination\\naccounting requirements. Refer to \\x93Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges\\x94 below for additional discussion of these items and Note\\xa016 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report\\nfor a reconciliation of the summations of our total segment revenues as presented below to total revenues as presented per our consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented.  In addition, research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets, certain other expense allocations, acquisition\\nrelated and other expenses, restructuring expenses, interest expense, non-operating income, net and provision for income taxes are not attributed to our operating segments because our management does not view the performance of our businesses\\nincluding such items and/or it is impractical to do so. Refer to \\x93Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges\\x94 below for additional discussion of certain of these items and Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nincluded elsewhere in this Annual Report for a reconciliation of the summations of total segment margin as presented below to total income before provision of income taxes as presented per our consolidated statements of operations for the periods\\npresented. \\n \\xa0 54 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Constant Currency Presentation  Our international operations have provided and are expected to continue to provide a significant portion of each of our businesses\\x92 revenues and expenses. As a result, each businesses\\x92 revenues\\nand expenses and our total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S.\\xa0Dollar against major international currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding\\nthe effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Annual Report using constant currency disclosure. To present this information, current and comparative prior\\nperiod results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e., the rates in effect on May\\xa031, 2016, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year) rather than the\\nactual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. For example, if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0\\xa0million Euros from products sold on May\\xa031, 2017 and 2016, our financial statements would reflect reported\\nrevenues of $1.11 million in fiscal 2017 (using 1.11 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period) and $1.12 million in fiscal 2016 (using 1.12 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period). The constant currency presentation,\\nhowever, would translate the fiscal 2017 results using the fiscal 2016 exchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during the period. In each of the tables below, we present the percent change based on actual, unrounded\\nresults in reported currency and in constant currency.

2016:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Excluding the effects of foreign currency rate variations, our total revenues increased in fiscal 2017 due to growth in our cloud\\nand on-premise software revenues and services revenues, partially offset by a decrease in our hardware revenues. The constant currency increase in our cloud and on-premise software revenues during fiscal 2017 was attributable to growth in our SaaS,\\nPaaS and IaaS revenues, growth in our software license updates and product support revenues, and revenue contributions from our recent acquisitions and was partially offset by a decrease in our new software licenses revenues. The constant\\n\\n \\xa0 55 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\ncurrency increase in our services revenues during fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to our recent acquisitions. The constant currency decrease in our hardware revenues during fiscal 2017 was\\nprimarily due to a reduction in our hardware products revenues and, to a lesser extent, a decline in our hardware support revenues. In constant currency, the Americas region contributed 54%, the EMEA region contributed 24% and the Asia Pacific\\nregion contributed 22% to the growth in our total revenues during fiscal 2017.  Excluding the effects of foreign currency rate variations, our\\ntotal operating expenses increased during fiscal 2017 relative to the prior year period due to higher sales and marketing and research and development expenses, which were primarily attributable to increased headcount and increased stock-based\\ncompensation expenses; and higher cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS expenses resulting primarily from increased headcount and infrastructure expenses to support the increase in our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues. These constant currency expense\\nincreases in fiscal 2017 were partially offset by lower hardware expenses in fiscal 2017 due to a decline in hardware products revenues and lower hardware support costs due primarily to lower headcount; lower software support costs in fiscal 2017\\ndue primarily to lower headcount; and lower intangible asset amortization in fiscal 2017 due to certain of our intangible assets that became fully amortized.  In constant currency, our total operating margin increased in fiscal 2017 due to the increase in our total revenues while total operating margin as a percentage of revenues was flat. \\nFiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our results of operations for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 were\\nsignificantly impacted by movements in international currencies relative to the U.S.\\xa0Dollar, which decreased our total revenues by 5 percentage points, total operating expenses by 4 percentage points and total operating margin by 7 percentage\\npoints.  Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations, our total revenues increased in fiscal 2016 due to constant currency\\ngrowth in our cloud and on-premise software business revenues and services business revenues due to similar reasons noted for the fiscal 2017 increases above. These constant currency increases in our revenues during fiscal 2016 were partially offset\\nby constant currency decreases in our hardware business revenues. In constant currency, the EMEA region and the Asia Pacific region contributed approximately equal amounts to our fiscal 2016 total revenues growth and the Americas region was flat.\\n Excluding the effects of favorable currency rate fluctuations, our total operating expenses increased during fiscal 2016 primarily due to\\nincreased sales and marketing and research and development expenses resulting primarily from increased headcount, increased cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS expenses resulting from increased headcount and infrastructure expenses to support the increase in\\nour cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues, higher restructuring expenses that were recorded pursuant to the Fiscal 2015 Oracle Restructuring Plan (2015 Restructuring Plan; see Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in\\nthis Annual Report), and higher general and administrative expenses due primarily to higher professional services fees, primarily legal related fees. These constant currency expense increases were partially offset by fiscal 2016 reductions in\\nexpenses associated with certain of our intangible assets that became fully amortized during fiscal 2016 and lower acquisition related and other expenses, which decreased relative to fiscal 2015 as a result of a goodwill impairment loss of $186\\nmillion that was recorded in fiscal 2015.  Excluding the effects of unfavorable foreign currency rate fluctuations, our total operating margin\\nand total operating margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2016 as our total expenses increased at a faster rate than our total revenues.

Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize the cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, software license updates and product support and hardware support revenue amounts as presented in the\\nabove table that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities upon delivery of the contractual obligations. To the extent customers to which these contractual obligations pertain renew these contracts with\\nus, we expect to recognize revenues for the full contracts\\x92 values over the respective contracts\\x92 renewal periods.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n(2)\\xa0\\n Certain acquired companies capitalized sales commissions associated with subscription agreements and amortized these amounts over the related\\ncontractual terms. Business combination accounting rules generally require us to eliminate these capitalized sales commissions balances as of the acquisition date and our post-combination GAAP sales and marketing expenses generally do not reflect\\nthe amortization of these deferred sales commissions balances. This adjustment is intended to include, and thus reflect, the full amount of amortization related to such balances as though the acquired companies operated independently in the periods\\npresented.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n(3)\\xa0\\n Represents the amortization of intangible assets, substantially all of which were acquired in connection with our acquisitions.

Income tax effects for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were calculated based on the applicable jurisdictional tax rates applied to the items within the table above and resulted in effective tax rates of 22.8%, 23.2% and\\n23.6%, respectively, instead of 18.9%, 22.2% and 22.6%, respectively, which represented our effective tax rates as derived per our consolidated statements of operations. The difference between our fiscal 2017 tax rate derived from the table above\\nand the tax rate derived from our consolidated statement of operations was primarily due to the net tax effects for stock-based compensation expense and acquisition related items, including the tax effects of amortization of intangible assets. The\\ndifference between our fiscal 2016 and 2015 tax rates derived from the table above and the tax rates derived from our consolidated statements of operations were primarily due to the net tax effects of acquisition related items, including the tax\\neffects of amortization of intangible assets.  Cloud and On-Premise Software Business \\nOur cloud and on-premise software business engages in the sale, marketing and delivery of our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings and the licensing of our\\nsoftware for on-premise and other IT environments with the option to purchase software license updates and product support contracts. Our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings are generally subscription based and generally recognized as revenues over\\nthe subscription period. New software licenses revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses, generally on a perpetual basis, to use our database and middleware and our applications software products within on-premise and other\\nIT\\xa0environments and are generally recognized when unrestricted access to the software license is granted provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Software license updates and product support revenues are typically generated\\nthrough the sale of software support contracts related to on-premise new software licenses purchased by our customers at their option and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual term. We continue to place significant\\nemphasis, both domestically and internationally, on direct sales through our own sales force. We also continue to market our offerings through indirect channels. Costs associated with our cloud and on-premise software business are included in cloud\\nSaaS, PaaS and IaaS expenses, software license updates and product support expenses, and sales and marketing expenses. These costs are largely personnel and infrastructure related including the cost of providing our cloud SaaS, PaaS, IaaS and\\nsoftware support offerings, salaries and commissions earned by our sales force for the sale of our cloud and software offerings, and marketing program costs. \\n \\xa0 58 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of

Compared to Fiscal 2016:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Excluding the effects of currency rate\\nfluctuations, total revenues from our cloud and on-premise software business increased in fiscal 2017 due to growth in our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues, growth in our software license updates and product support revenues and revenue\\ncontributions from our recent acquisitions, including our acquisition of NetSuite. These fiscal 2017 increases were partially offset by decreases in our new software licenses revenues. The increases in our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues and\\ndecreases in our new software licenses revenues during fiscal 2017 were primarily due to the continued strategic emphasis placed on selling, marketing and growing our cloud offerings and we expect these revenue trends will continue. The increase in\\nour fiscal 2017 software license updates and product support revenues was a result of substantially all customers electing to purchase software support contracts in conjunction with their new software licenses purchased, and due to the renewal of\\nsubstantially all of the software support customer base eligible for renewal during the fiscal 2017 and 2016 periods. During fiscal 2017, the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions contributed constant currency regional growth of 63%, 20% and 17%,\\nrespectively.  In constant currency, total cloud and on-premise software expenses increased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher sales and\\nmarketing expenses resulting from increased headcount, and higher cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS expenses resulting primarily from increased headcount and technology infrastructure expenses that were incurred to support the related cloud SaaS, PaaS and\\nIaaS revenues increases. These fiscal 2017 expense increases were partially offset by lower software license updates and product support expenses in fiscal 2017 due primarily to lower employee related expenses resulting from lower headcount.\\n Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and on-premise software business\\x92 total margin increased due to the\\nincrease in revenues and total margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2017 as our total expenses grew at a faster rate than our total revenues for this business. \\n \\xa0 59 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Excluding the effects of\\nunfavorable currency rate fluctuations of 5\\xa0percentage points, total revenues from our cloud and on-premise software business increased by 3 percentage points during fiscal 2016 relative to fiscal 2015 due to similar reasons as noted above for\\nthe increase in fiscal 2017 revenues relative to fiscal 2016. During fiscal 2016, the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions contributed constant currency regional growth of 19%, 38% and 43%, respectively. \\nExcluding the effects of favorable currency rate fluctuations of 4 percentage points, total cloud software and\\non-premise software expenses increased during fiscal 2016 primarily due to higher sales and marketing expenses resulting from increased headcount, and higher cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS expenses resulting from\\nincreased headcount and technology infrastructure expenses that were incurred to support the related cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues increases.  Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and on-premise software business\\x92 total margin and total margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2016 due\\nprimarily to the growth in our total expenses for this business.  Hardware Business \\nOur hardware business revenues are generated from the sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems, computer server, storage, and industry-specific hardware\\nproducts for on-premise IT environments that are generally recognized upon delivery to the customer provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Our hardware business also earns revenues from the sale of hardware support contracts\\npurchased by our customers at their option and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual term. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels such as independent distributors and value-added\\nresellers and we also market and sell our hardware products through our direct sales force. Operating expenses associated with our hardware business include the cost of hardware products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to\\nproduce these products by our internal manufacturing operations or by third-party manufacturers, warranty expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the impact of inventory determined to be excess and obsolete; the\\ncost of materials used to repair customer products; the cost of labor and infrastructure to provide support services; and sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include variable compensation earned by our sales force\\nfor the sales of our hardware offerings.

Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware revenues decreased in fiscal 2017 and 2016, each\\nrelative to the corresponding prior year period, due to lower hardware products revenues and, to a lesser \\n \\xa0 60 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nextent, lower hardware support revenues. The decreases in hardware products revenues in both fiscal 2017 and 2016, each relative to the corresponding prior year periods, were primarily\\nattributable to reductions in sales volumes of certain of our product lines, including lower margin products, partially offset by revenues growth in certain of our Oracle Engineered Systems products. The decreases in hardware support revenues in\\nfiscal 2017 and 2016, each in comparison to the corresponding prior year periods, were primarily due to reductions in the hardware support customer contract base that resulted from a reduction in the volume and amount of hardware support agreements\\nassociated with lower hardware product revenues.  Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware expenses decreased in\\neach of fiscal 2017 and 2016 relative to the corresponding prior year periods primarily due to lower hardware products costs associated with lower hardware products revenues, lower employee expenses resulting from lower headcount, and lower external\\ncontractor expenses.  In constant currency, total margin decreased in fiscal 2017 and 2016, each in comparison to the corresponding prior year\\nperiods, due to the decreases in hardware revenues during these periods. Total margin as a percentage of revenues for our hardware business increased in fiscal 2017 in comparison to fiscal 2016 due to lower expenses resulting primarily from lower\\nheadcount. Total margin as a percentage of revenues for our hardware business decreased in fiscal 2016 in comparison to fiscal 2015 primarily due to the decrease in fiscal 2016 hardware revenues. \\nServices Business  We offer services to\\ncustomers and partners to help to maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications, platform and infrastructure technologies.

Provision for Income\\nTaxes:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our effective tax rate in all periods is the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates. The provision for income taxes differs from the tax\\ncomputed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to certain earnings considered as indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with tax authorities and the\\nU.S. domestic production activity deduction. In addition, beginning in fiscal 2017, the provision for income taxes also differs from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory tax rate due to tax effects of stock-based compensation (refer to\\nNote 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional discussion). Future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by an unfavorable shift of earnings weighted to jurisdictions with\\nhigher tax rates, by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations or by adverse rulings in tax related litigation, among others. \\n \\xa0 64 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nYear Ended May\\xa031,\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nPercent Change\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nPercent Change\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n (Dollars in millions)\\n\\xa0\\n2017\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nActual\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nConstant\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2016\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nActual\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nConstant\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2015\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Provision for income taxes\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa02,182\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0-14%\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n-15%\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa02,541\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0-12%\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n-5%\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa02,896\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Effective tax rate\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n18.9%\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n22.2%\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n22.6%\\n\\xa0\\n Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Provision for income taxes in fiscal 2017\\ndecreased relative to fiscal 2016 primarily due to the favorable impact of excess tax benefits recognized in fiscal 2017 that related to stock-based compensation, which were recorded as a benefit to provision for income taxes in fiscal 2017, in\\ncomparison to fiscal 2016 when such benefits were recognized as an increase to additional paid in capital (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional discussion). To a lesser\\nextent, the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2017 also benefited from a favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings, as well as net favorable changes relating to unrecognized tax benefits from audit settlements, statute of limitation releases, and\\nother events.  Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Provision for income taxes in fiscal 2016 decreased,\\nrelative to the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2015, due in substantial part to lower net income before provision for income taxes during fiscal 2016, settlements with certain tax authorities, and the retroactive extension of the U.S. research\\nand development tax credit, which collectively were partially offset by unfavorable changes in the jurisdictional mix of our earnings during fiscal 2016.

These favorable working capital movements were partially offset by cash used for acquisitions, including $9.0 billion of net cash used for our acquisition of NetSuite in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, cash used for repurchases\\nof our common stock, cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders and cash used for capital expenditures.  Working capital as of May\\xa031,\\n2016 in comparison to May\\xa031, 2015 was substantially flat as favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal 2016 and cash proceeds from fiscal 2016 stock option exercises were substantially offset by\\n$10.4 billion of cash used for repurchases of our common stock in fiscal 2016, $2.5 billion of cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders in fiscal 2016, and $1.2 billion of cash used for capital expenditures in fiscal 2016. \\nOur working capital may be impacted by some or all of the aforementioned factors in future periods, the amounts and timing of which are variable.\\n Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits\\nheld at major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper and other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities consist of Tier-1 commercial paper debt securities, corporate debt securities and certain other securities. The\\nincrease in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May\\xa031, 2017 in comparison to May\\xa031, 2016 was primarily due to cash inflows generated by our operations during fiscal 2017, $13.6 billion of cash inflows, net of repayments,\\nfrom fiscal 2017 debt issuances, and cash inflows from stock option exercises. These fiscal 2017 cash inflows were partially offset by certain fiscal 2017 cash outflows, primarily acquisitions, including our acquisition of NetSuite, repurchases of\\nour common stock, payments of cash dividends to our stockholders and cash used for capital expenditures. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities included $54.4 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries as of May\\xa031, 2017. We consider\\n$47.5 billion \\n \\xa0 65 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nof our undistributed earnings as indefinitely reinvested in our foreign operations outside the United States. These undistributed earnings would be subject to U.S. income tax if repatriated to\\nthe United States. Assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits, the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings would be approximately $15.1 billion as of May\\xa031, 2017 should the amounts be\\nrepatriated to the United States. The amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances held by our foreign\\nsubsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in our\\nconsolidated balance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report). As the U.S.\\xa0Dollar generally strengthened against certain major international\\ncurrencies during fiscal 2017, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for these subsidiaries decreased on a net basis as of May\\xa031, 2017 relative to what we would have reported using\\nconstant currency rates from our May\\xa031, 2016 balance sheet date.  The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at\\nMay\\xa031, 2016 in comparison to May\\xa031, 2015 was primarily due to cash inflows generated by our operations during fiscal 2016, $1.8 billion of net cash inflows from fiscal 2016 debt issuances, net of debt repayments, and cash inflows from\\nfiscal 2016 stock option exercises. These fiscal 2016 cash inflows were partially offset by certain fiscal 2016 cash outflows, primarily $10.4 billion for repurchases of our common stock, payments of cash dividends to our stockholders, and cash used\\nfor capital expenditures. Additionally, our reported cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of May\\xa031, 2016 decreased on a net basis in comparison to May\\xa031, 2015 as the U.S.\\xa0Dollar generally strengthened in\\ncomparison to most major international currencies during fiscal 2016.  Days sales outstanding, which we calculate by dividing period end\\naccounts receivable by average daily sales for the quarter, was 44 days at May\\xa031, 2017 compared with 46 days at May\\xa031, 2016. The days sales outstanding calculation excludes the impact of any revenue adjustments resulting from business\\ncombinations that reduced our acquired cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS obligations, software license updates and product support obligations and hardware obligations to fair value. \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nYear Ended May\\xa031,\\n\\xa0\\n\\n (Dollars in millions)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2017\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nChange\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2016\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nChange\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2015\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Net cash provided by operating activities\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa014,126\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n3%\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa013,685\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n-6%\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa014,580\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Net cash used for investing activities\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n(21,494\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n317%\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n(5,154\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n-73%\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n(19,047\\n)\\xa0\\n\\n Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n9,086\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n191%\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n(9,980\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n-204%\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n9,606\\n\\xa0\\n Cash flows from operating activities:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our largest source of operating cash flows is\\ncash collections from our customers following the purchase and renewal of their software license updates and product support agreements. Payments from customers for these support agreements are generally received near the beginning of the\\ncontracts\\x92 terms, which are generally one year in length. Over the course of a fiscal year, we also have historically generated cash from the sales of new software licenses, cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, hardware products, hardware\\nsupport arrangements and services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee related expenditures, material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware products, taxes and leased facilities.\\n Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Net cash provided by operating activities increased during fiscal 2017\\nprimarily due to the cash favorable effects of higher net income in fiscal 2017 in relation to fiscal 2016.  Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal\\n2015: Net cash provided by operating activities decreased in fiscal 2016 primarily due to the cash unfavorable effects of lower net income and the related unfavorable currency rate fluctuations on our net income relative to the corresponding\\nprior year period.  Cash flows from investing activities:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The changes in cash flows from investing\\nactivities primarily relate to our acquisitions, the timing of our purchases, maturities and sales of our investments in marketable debt securities and investments in capital and other assets, including certain intangible assets, to support our\\ngrowth. \\n \\xa0 66 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Net cash used for investing activities\\nincreased in fiscal 2017 relative to fiscal 2016 primarily due to an increase in cash used for acquisitions, net of cash acquired in fiscal 2017, an increase in cash used to purchase marketable securities and other investments (net of proceeds\\nreceived from sales and maturities) in fiscal 2017 and increased capital expenditures primarily related to our fiscal 2017 real estate purchases and investments in equipment to support our infrastructure to deliver our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS\\nofferings.  Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Net cash used for investing activities decreased in fiscal 2016\\nrelative to fiscal 2015 primarily due to a decrease in net cash used to purchase marketable securities (net of proceeds received from sales and maturities) in fiscal 2016 and a decrease in cash used for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, in fiscal\\n2016.  Cash flows from financing activities:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily\\nrelate to borrowings and repayments related to our debt instruments as well as stock repurchases, dividend payments and net proceeds related to employee stock programs.  Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2017 was $9.1 billion in comparison to net cash used for financing activities of\\n$10.0 billion during fiscal 2016. The change in financing activities cash flows during fiscal 2017 in comparison to fiscal 2016 was primarily related to borrowing activities, net of debt repayments and stock repurchase activity. We received $13.6\\nbillion of net cash inflows from borrowing activities during fiscal 2017 in comparison to $1.8 billion of net cash inflows from fiscal 2016 borrowing activities. In addition, we significantly reduced our stock repurchase activity in fiscal 2017,\\nusing $3.6\\xa0billion, in comparison to fiscal 2016 when we used $10.4 billion.  Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal\\n2015:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We used net cash for financing activities of $10.0 billion during fiscal 2016 in comparison to net cash provided by financing activities of $9.6 billion during fiscal 2015. The change in financing activities cash\\nflows during fiscal 2016 in comparison to fiscal 2015 was primarily related to borrowing activities, net of debt repayments, and stock repurchase activities. Our borrowing activities, net of repurchases, provided $1.8 billion of net cash inflows in\\nfiscal 2016 in comparison to $18.3 billion of net cash inflows in fiscal 2015. We used $10.4 billion for fiscal 2016 common stock repurchases in comparison to $8.1 billion used for fiscal 2015 common stock repurchase. \\nFree cash flow:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of\\ncash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to analyze cash flows generated from our operations. We believe that free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free\\ncash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.

We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis to financial institutions within 90 days\\nof the contracts\\x92 dates of execution. We generally record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing\\nreceivables. We financed $912 million in fiscal 2017, $1.2 billion in 2016 and $1.6 billion in fiscal 2015, respectively, approximately 14%, 16% and 19% of our new software licenses revenues in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. \\n \\xa0 67 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Recent Financing Activities:  Cash Dividends:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In fiscal 2017, we declared and paid cash dividends of $0.64 per share that totaled $2.6\\xa0billion. In June 2017, our Board of Directors declared a\\nquarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share of our outstanding common stock payable on August\\xa02, 2017 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July\\xa019, 2017. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future\\nrecord and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.  Revolving Credit\\nAgreements:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In May 2017, we entered into four revolving credit agreements with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as initial lender and administrative agent (the 2017 Credit Agreements) and borrowed $3.8\\xa0billion pursuant to\\nthese agreements. The 2017 Credit Agreements provided us with short-term borrowings for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Interest for the 2017 Credit Agreements is based on either (1)\\xa0a LIBOR-based formula or (2)\\xa0a\\nbase rate formula, each as set forth in the 2017 Credit Agreements. The borrowings are due and payable on June\\xa029, 2017, which is the termination date of the 2017 Credit Agreements. Additional details regarding the 2017 Credit Agreements are\\nincluded in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.  In May 2016, we borrowed $3.8\\nbillion pursuant to three revolving credit agreements with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as initial lender and administrative agent (the 2016 Credit Agreements). In June 2016, we repaid the $3.8 billion and the 2016 Credit Agreements expired pursuant\\nto their terms.  Senior Notes:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In July 2016, we issued $14.0 billion of senior notes comprised of the following:\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n $4.25 billion of 1.90% senior notes due September 2021; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n $2.5 billion of 2.40% senior notes due September 2023; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n $3.0 billion of 2.65% senior notes due July 2026;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n $1.25 billion of 3.85% senior notes due July 2036; and \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n $3.0 billion of 4.00% senior notes due July 2046.  We issued the senior notes for general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on our common stock, repayment of indebtedness and future acquisitions. Additional\\ndetails regarding the senior notes are included in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.  Other Fiscal 2017 Borrowings Activities:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In connection with our acquisition of NetSuite in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we assumed $310\\xa0million par value of legacy\\nNetSuite convertible notes (NetSuite Debt), which had a fair value of $342\\xa0million as of the acquisition date. In December 2016, we repurchased and settled for cash substantially all of the NetSuite Debt (refer to Note 8 of Notes to\\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for additional discussion).  In the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we assumed\\n$113 million of debt due August\\xa01, 2025 in connection with the acquisition of certain land and buildings.  Common Stock\\nRepurchases:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. As of May\\xa031, 2017, approximately $5.3 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock\\nrepurchase program. We repurchased 85.6\\xa0million shares for $3.5 billion, 271.9\\xa0million shares for $10.4 billion, and 193.7\\xa0million shares for $8.1 billion in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our stock repurchase authorization\\ndoes not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations (described further below)\\nor repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases and pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be\\naccelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.  Contractual Obligations:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The contractual\\nobligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under our fixed contractual obligations and commitments. Changes in our business needs, \\n \\xa0 68 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\ncancellation provisions, changing interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from these estimates.

Principal and interest payments for these senior notes were\\ncalculated and presented in the table above based on the terms of these cross-currency swap agreements. Principal and interest payments for our other Euro-denominated senior notes presented in the contractual obligations table above were estimated\\nusing foreign currency exchange rates as of May\\xa031, 2017 and are subject to change in future periods.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nRefer to Notes 8 and 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information related to our notes payable\\nand other borrowings and related derivative agreements.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n(2)\\xa0\\n Primarily represents leases of facilities and includes future minimum rent payments for facilities that we have vacated pursuant to our restructuring\\nand merger integration activities.

We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for our hardware products and to perform final assembly and\\ntesting of finished hardware products. We also obtain individual hardware components for our products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and\\nmanufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead-times and/or commercially standard lead-times for the particular part or product and have been included in the amount presented in the above contractual\\nobligations table. Routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to our external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in the ordinary course of business are not included in the amounts\\npresented above, as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way.  As of May\\xa031, 2017, we had $5.8 billion of gross unrecognized income tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, and all such obligations have\\nbeen excluded from the contractual obligations table above due to the uncertainty as to when they might be settled. We cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which the remainder of our unrecognized income tax benefits will be\\nsettled or released with the relevant tax authorities, although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal 2018. We are involved in claims and\\xa0legal proceedings. All such\\nclaims and obligations have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above due to the uncertainty of claims and legal proceedings and associated estimates and assumptions, all of which are inherently unpredictable and many aspects of\\nwhich are out of our control. Notes 15 and 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report includes additional information regarding these contingencies. \\nWe believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working\\ncapital, capital expenditures and contractual obligation requirements. In \\n \\xa0 69 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\naddition, we believe that we could fund our future acquisitions, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable\\nsecurities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities.  Off-Balance Sheet\\nArrangements:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses,\\nresults of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.  Selected Quarterly Financial\\nData  Quarterly revenues, expenses and operating income have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including the\\nstructure of sales force incentive compensation plans. In addition, our European operations generally provide lower revenues in our first fiscal quarter because of the reduced economic activity in Europe during the summer. These seasonal factors are\\ncommon in the technology industry. These factors have historically caused a decrease in our first quarter revenues as compared to revenues in the immediately preceding fourth quarter, which historically has been our highest revenue quarter within a\\nparticular fiscal year. Similarly, the operating income of our business is affected by seasonal factors in a similar manner as our revenues (in\\xa0particular, our cloud and on-premise software business and hardware business) as certain expenses\\nwithin our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short term. We expect these trends to continue in fiscal 2018.  The following tables set\\nforth selected unaudited quarterly information for our last eight fiscal quarters. We believe that all necessary adjustments, which consisted only of normal recurring adjustments, have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the\\nresults of such periods when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The sum of the quarterly financial information may vary from annual data due to rounding.\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nFiscal 2017 Quarter Ended (Unaudited)\\n\\xa0\\n\\n (in millions, except per share amounts)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nAugust\\xa031\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nNovember\\xa030\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nFebruary\\xa028\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nMay\\xa031\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Revenues\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n8,595\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n9,035\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n9,205\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa010,892\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Gross profit\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n6,819\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n7,237\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n7,314\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n8,889\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Operating income\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n2,641\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n3,037\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n2,959\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n4,073\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Net income\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n1,832\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n2,032\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n2,239\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n3,231\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Earnings per share\\x97basic\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.44\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.50\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.55\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.78\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Earnings per share\\x97diluted\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.43\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.48\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.53\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.76\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nFiscal 2016 Quarter Ended (Unaudited)\\n\\xa0\\n\\n (in millions, except per share amounts)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nAugust\\xa031\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nNovember\\xa030\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nFebruary\\xa029\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nMay\\xa031\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Revenues\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n8,448\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n8,993\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n9,012\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa010,594\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Gross profit\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n6,561\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n7,105\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n7,139\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n8,640\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Operating income\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n2,654\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n2,955\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n3,027\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n3,968\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Net income\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n1,747\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n2,197\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n2,142\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n2,814\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Earnings per share\\x97basic\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.40\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.52\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.51\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.68\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Earnings per share\\x97diluted\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.40\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.51\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.50\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.66\\n\\xa0\\n Restricted Stock-Based Awards and Stock Options  Our stock-based compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of\\nexisting stockholders.  We recognize that restricted stock-based awards and stock options dilute existing stockholders and have sought to\\ncontrol the number of stock-based awards granted while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June\\xa01, 2014 has been a weighted-average annualized rate of\\n1.2%\\xa0per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new restricted stock-based awards or stock options granted and assumed, net of restricted stock-based\\n\\n \\xa0 70 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nawards and stock options forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by the weighted-average outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only\\nresult if all restricted stock-based awards vest and stock options are exercised. Of the outstanding stock options at May\\xa031, 2017, which generally have a ten-year exercise period, less than 1% have exercise prices higher than the market price\\nof our common stock on such date. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock-based compensation program. However, we have recently reduced the level of our stock repurchases and we may further\\nreduce repurchases in the future in order to use our available cash for acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes. At May\\xa031, 2017, the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding restricted\\nstock-based awards and unexercised stock options, regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including stock options where the strike price is higher than the market price as of such date, was 9.5%. \\nDuring fiscal 2017, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviewed and approved the organization-wide stock-based award grants to selected\\nemployees, all stock-based award grants to executive officers and any individual grant of stock-based awards in excess of 100,000 stock option equivalent shares. A separate Plan Committee, which is an executive officer committee, approved individual\\nstock-based award grants of up to 100,000 stock option equivalent shares to non-executive officers and employees.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  For information with respect to recent accounting\\npronouncements, if any, and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, if any, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. \\n \\xa0 71 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Item\\xa07A.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures\\nAbout Market Risk  Cash, Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities and Interest Income Risk \\nOur bank deposits and time deposits are generally held with large, diverse financial institutions worldwide with high investment-grade credit ratings or\\nfinancial institutions that meet investment-grade ratings criteria, which we believe mitigates credit risk and certain other risks. In addition, as of May\\xa031, 2017, substantially all of our marketable securities are high quality with\\napproximately 32% having maturity dates within one year and 68% having maturity dates within one to five years (a description of our marketable securities held is included in Note\\xa03 and Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nincluded elsewhere in this Annual Report and \\x93Liquidity and Capital Resources\\x94 above). We hold a mix of both fixed and floating-rate debt securities. The fair values of our fixed-rate debt securities are impacted by interest rate movements\\nand if interest rates would have been higher by 50 basis points as of May\\xa031, 2017, we estimate the change would have decreased the fair values of our marketable securities holdings by $348 million. Our floating-rate debt securities serve to\\nlower the overall risk to our investments portfolio associated with the risk of rising interest rates. Substantially all of our marketable securities are designated as available-for-sale. We generally do not use our investments for trading purposes.\\n Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our cash, cash equivalents and marketable\\nsecurities. For fiscal 2017, total interest income was $802 million with our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities investments yielding an average 1.47% on a worldwide basis. The table below presents the approximate fair values of our\\ncash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the related weighted-average interest rates for our investment portfolio at May\\xa031, 2017 and 2016.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nMay\\xa031,\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2017\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2016\\n\\xa0\\n\\n (Dollars in millions)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nFair Value\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nWeighted-AverageInterestRate\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nFair Value\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nWeighted-AverageInterestRate\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Cash and cash equivalents\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa021,784\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n0.63%\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa020,152\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n0.35%\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Marketable securities\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n44,294\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n1.88%\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n35,973\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n1.62%\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n66,078\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n1.47%\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n56,125\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n1.16%\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Interest Expense Risk  Interest Expense Risk\\x97Fixed to Variable Interest Rate Swap Agreements   Our total borrowings were $57.9 billion as of May\\xa031, 2017, consisting of $51.9 billion of fixed-rate borrowings, $2.3 billion of floating-rate borrowings (Floating-Rate Notes) and $3.8 billion of\\nother borrowings, primarily under revolving credit agreements.  We have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the\\neconomic effect of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with our $1.5 billion of 2.375% senior notes due January 2019 (January 2019 Notes), our $2.0 billion of 2.25% senior notes due October 2019 (October 2019 Notes), and our $1.5\\nbillion of 2.80% senior notes due July 2021 (July 2021 Notes) so that the interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. The critical terms of the interest rate swap agreements match the critical terms of the\\nJanuary 2019 Notes, October 2019 Notes, and July 2021 Notes that the interest rate swap agreements pertain to, including the notional amounts and maturity dates. We do not use these interest rate swap arrangements or our fixed-rate borrowings for\\ntrading purposes. We are accounting for these interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815). The total fair value gain of these fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements as of\\nMay\\xa031, 2017 was $40 million. If LIBOR-based interest rates would have been higher by 100 basis points as of May\\xa031, 2017, the change would have decreased the fair values of the fixed to variable swap agreements by $153 million. Additional\\ndetails regarding our senior notes and related interest rate swap agreements are included in Notes 8 and 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. \\n \\xa0 72 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n By issuing the Floating-Rate Notes and by entering into the aforementioned interest rate swap arrangements,\\nwe have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon LIBOR.\\xa0As of May\\xa031, 2017, the weighted-average interest rate associated with our Floating-Rate Notes and January 2019 Notes, October 2019 Notes and July 2021 Notes\\nafter considering the effects of the aforementioned interest rate swap arrangements, was 1.68%. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations.\\xa0An\\ninterest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest rates.\\xa0As of May\\xa031, 2017, if\\xa0LIBOR-based interest rates\\nwould have been higher by 100 basis points, the change would have increased our interest expense annually by approximately $73 million as it relates to our fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements and floating-rate borrowings. \\nCurrency Risk  Foreign Currency\\nTransaction Risk\\x97Foreign Currency Forward Contracts  We transact business in various foreign currencies and have\\nestablished a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward\\ncontracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions. We\\nmay suspend this program from time to time. Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees, intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in\\nduration.  Neither do we use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as\\nhedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815. Accordingly, we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statement of\\noperations. Given the short duration of the forward contracts, amounts recorded generally are not significant. The balance sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is prepaid expenses and other current assets for forward\\ncontracts in an unrealized gain position and other current liabilities for forward contracts in an unrealized loss position. The statement of operations classification for changes in fair values of these forward contracts is non-operating income,\\nnet for both realized and unrealized gains and losses.  We expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign\\ncurrency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we\\nenter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors. As of May\\xa031, 2017 and 2016, the notional amounts of\\nthe forward contracts we held to purchase U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $3.4 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. As of May\\xa031, 2017 and 2016, the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell\\nU.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $1.4 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal at May\\xa031, 2017 and 2016. Net foreign\\nexchange transaction losses included in non-operating income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $152 million, $110\\xa0million and $157 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As a large portion of our\\nconsolidated operations are international, we could experience additional foreign currency volatility in the future, the amounts and timing of which are unknown.  Foreign Currency Translation Risk\\x97Impact on Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities  Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into U.S. Dollars. In particular, the\\namount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by these subsidiaries is subject to translation variance caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of\\n\\n \\xa0 73 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nthe end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheets and is also presented as a\\nline item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report).  As the U.S.\\xa0Dollar fluctuated\\nagainst certain international currencies as of the end of fiscal 2017, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for foreign subsidiaries that hold international currencies as of May\\xa031,\\n2017 decreased relative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate from May\\xa031, 2016. As reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, the estimated effects of exchange rate changes on our reported cash and cash\\nequivalents balances in U.S. Dollars for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were decreases of $86 million, $115 million and $1.2 billion, respectively. The following table includes estimates of the U.S.\\xa0Dollar equivalent of cash, cash equivalents and\\nmarketable securities denominated in certain major foreign currencies that we held as of May\\xa031, 2017:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n (in millions)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nU.S\\nDollarEquivalent\\xa0atMay\\xa031, 2017\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Euro\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n1,331\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Canadian Dollar\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n450\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Japanese Yen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n409\\n\\xa0\\n\\n British Pound\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n277\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Indian Rupee\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n266\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Russian Ruble\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n253\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Australian Dollar\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n237\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Chinese Renminbi\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n174\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Other foreign currencies\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n1,780\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated in foreign currencies\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n5,177\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n If overall foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the U.S.\\xa0Dollar uniformly would have been weaker by 10%,\\nthe amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities we would report in U.S. Dollars would have decreased by approximately $518 million, assuming constant foreign currency cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances.\\n Foreign Currency Translation Risk\\x97Net Investment Hedge  \\nIn July 2013, we issued \\x80750\\xa0million of 3.125% senior notes due July 2025 (July 2025 Notes). We designated the July 2025 Notes as a net\\ninvestment hedge of our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholders\\x92 equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates\\nof the Euro with respect to the U.S. Dollar. As a result, provided there is no ineffectiveness related to the hedge, the change in the carrying value of the Euro-denominated July 2025 Notes due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on\\nthe effective portion is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report and\\ntotaled $1\\xa0million of net other comprehensive losses for fiscal 2017. Any remaining change in the carrying value of the July 2025 Notes representing any ineffective portion of the net investment hedge is recognized in non-operating income, net.\\nWe did not record any ineffectiveness during fiscal 2017.  Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the Euro and the U.S.\\xa0Dollar will\\nimpact the amount of U.S. Dollars that we will require to settle the July 2025 Notes at maturity. If the U.S.\\xa0Dollar would have been weaker by 10% in comparison to the Euro as of May\\xa031, 2017, we estimate our obligation to cash settle the\\nprincipal portion of the July 2025 Notes in U.S. Dollars would have increased by approximately $83 million. \\nItem\\xa08.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Financial Statements and Supplementary Data \\nThe response to this item is submitted as a separate section of this Annual Report.

Item\\xa09A.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Controls and Procedures \\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our Disclosure Committee and our management,\\nincluding our Principal Executive Officers (one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e).\\nDisclosure controls are procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, such as this Annual Report on Form 10-K, is recorded,\\nprocessed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Disclosure controls are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including\\nour Principal Executive Officers (one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer), as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our quarterly evaluation of disclosure controls includes an evaluation of some components of\\nour internal control over financial reporting. We also perform a separate annual evaluation of internal control over financial reporting for the purpose of providing the management report below. \\nThe evaluation of our disclosure controls included a review of their objectives and design, our implementation of the controls and the effect of the\\ncontrols on the information generated for use in this Annual Report on Form\\xa010-K. In the course of the controls evaluation, we reviewed data errors or control problems identified and sought to confirm\\nthat appropriate corrective actions, including process improvements, were being undertaken. This type of evaluation is performed on a quarterly basis so that the conclusions of management, including our Principal Executive Officers (one of whom is\\nour Principal Financial Officer), concerning the effectiveness of the disclosure controls can be reported in our periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K. Many of the components of our disclosure controls are also evaluated on an ongoing basis by\\nboth our internal audit and finance organizations. The overall goals of these various evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and to modify them as necessary. We intend to maintain our disclosure controls as dynamic processes\\nand procedures that we adjust as circumstances merit.  Based on our management\\x92s evaluation (with the participation of our Principal\\nExecutive Officers, one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our Principal Executive Officers have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. \\nManagement\\x92s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting  Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the\\nsupervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive Officers (one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer), we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting\\nas of May\\xa031, 2017 based on the guidelines established in Internal Control\\x97Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\\x92s 2013 framework. Our internal control over\\nfinancial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\\n Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of\\nMay\\xa031, 2017. We reviewed the results of management\\x92s assessment with our Finance and Audit Committee.  The effectiveness of our\\ninternal control over financial reporting as of May\\xa031, 2017 has been audited by Ernst\\xa0& Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Part\\xa0IV, Item\\xa015 of this\\nAnnual Report. \\n \\xa0 75 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting \\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d)\\xa0of\\nExchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls  Our management, including our Principal Executive Officers (one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer), believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial\\nreporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control\\nover financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design\\nof a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide\\nabsolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error\\nor mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain\\nassumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in\\nconditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. \\nItem\\xa09B.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Other Information  None. \\n \\xa0 76 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n PART III \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nItem\\xa010.\\nDirectors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance  Pursuant to General Instruction G(3) of Form 10-K, the information required by this item relating to our executive officers is included under the caption \\x93Executive Officers of the Registrant\\x94\\nin Part I of this Annual Report.

Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item\\xa015(a) 2. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of\\nthe Company\\x92s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.  We\\nconducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements\\nare free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates\\nmade by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Oracle Corporation at May\\xa031, 2017 and 2016, and the\\nconsolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May\\xa031, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement\\nschedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Oracle Corporation\\x92s internal control over financial reporting as of\\nMay\\xa031, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated June\\xa027, 2017 expressed an\\nunqualified opinion thereon.  /s/ Ernst\\xa0& Young LLP  San Jose, California  June\\xa027, 2017 \\n \\xa0 79 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \\nThe Board of Directors and Stockholders of Oracle Corporation  We have audited Oracle Corporation\\x92s internal control over financial reporting as of May\\xa031, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control\\x97Integrated Framework issued by the\\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Oracle Corporation\\x92s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of\\nthe effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management\\x92s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company\\x92s internal control\\nover financial reporting based on our audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting\\nOversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included\\nobtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing\\nsuch other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \\nA company\\x92s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial\\nreporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\\x92s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that\\n(1)\\xa0pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)\\xa0provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as\\nnecessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors\\nof the company; and (3)\\xa0provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\\x92s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\n Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of\\nany evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \\nIn our opinion, Oracle Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May\\xa031, 2017,\\nbased on the COSO criteria.  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\\nStates), the consolidated balance sheets of Oracle Corporation as of May\\xa031, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended\\nMay\\xa031, 2017 of Oracle Corporation

manufactures, markets, sells, hosts and supports applications, platform and infrastructure technologies for information technology (IT) environments including applications\\nsoftware, database and middleware software, hardware\\x97including Oracle Engineered Systems, computer server, storage and industry-specific hardware products\\x97and related services that are engineered to work together in cloud-based and\\non-premise IT environments. We offer our customers the option to deploy our comprehensive set of cloud offerings including Oracle Cloud Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) or to purchase\\nour software and hardware products and related services to manage their own cloud-based or on-premise IT environments. Customers that purchase our software products may elect to purchase software license updates and product support contracts, which\\nprovide our customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period as well as technical support assistance. Customers that purchase our hardware products may elect to purchase\\nhardware support contracts, which provide customers with software updates and can include product repairs, maintenance services, and technical support services. We also offer customers a broad set of services offerings that are designed to improve\\ncustomer utilization of their investments in Oracle applications, platform and infrastructure technologies.  Oracle Corporation conducts\\nbusiness globally and was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun in June 1977. \\nBasis of Financial Statements  The\\nconsolidated financial statements included our accounts and the accounts of our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. Noncontrolling interest positions of certain of our consolidated entities are reported as a separate component of consolidated\\nequity from the equity attributable to Oracle\\x92s stockholders for all periods presented. The noncontrolling interests in our net income were not significant to our consolidated results for the periods presented and therefore have been included\\nas a component of non-operating income, net in our consolidated statements of operations. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Certain other prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current year\\npresentation. Such reclassifications did not affect total revenues, operating income or net income.  Included in acquisition related and other\\nexpenses as presented in our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2016 and 2015 are an acquisition related benefit of $19 million and a litigation related benefit of $53\\xa0million, respectively. Further, acquisition related and other\\nexpenses for fiscal 2015 included $186 million related to a goodwill impairment loss.  In fiscal 2017, we adopted Accounting Standards Update\\n(ASU) 2016-09, Compensation\\x97Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (ASU 2016-09). As required by ASU\\xa02016-09, excess tax benefits recognized on stock-based compensation expense are\\nreflected in the consolidated statements of operations as a component of the provision for income taxes on a prospective basis. As required by ASU 2016-09, excess tax benefits recognized on stock-based compensation expense are classified as an\\noperating activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows and we have applied this provision on a retrospective basis. For fiscal 2016 and 2015, net cash provided by operating activities increased by $124 million and $244 million,\\nrespectively, with a corresponding offset to net cash used for financing activities. Finally, ASU\\xa02016-09 allows for the option to account for forfeitures as they occur, rather than estimating expected forfeitures over the course of a vesting\\nperiod. We have elected to account for forfeitures as they occur and the net cumulative effect of this change was recognized as a $9 million increase to additional paid in capital, a $3\\xa0million increase to deferred tax assets and a $6 million\\nreduction to retained earnings as of June\\xa01, 2016.  In addition, in fiscal 2017, we also adopted the following Accounting Standards\\nUpdates, none of which had a material impact to our reported financial position or results of operations and cash flows:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n ASU 2017-09, Compensation\\x97Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting; \\n \\xa0 86 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2017  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n ASU 2016-17, Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control; and \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. \\nUse of Estimates  Our consolidated\\nfinancial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board\\x92s (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), and we consider the various\\nstaff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and\\nassumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and\\nliabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent that there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual\\nresults, our consolidated financial statements will be affected. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management\\x92s judgment in its application. There are also\\nareas in which management\\x92s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. \\nRevenue Recognition  Our sources of\\nrevenues include:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n cloud and on-premise software revenues, which include the sale of: cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, which generally grant customers access to a\\nbroad range of our applications, platform and infrastructure technologies and related support and services offerings on a subscription basis in a secure, standards-based cloud computing environment; new software licenses, which generally grant to\\ncustomers a perpetual right to use our database, middleware, applications and industry-specific software products; and software license updates and product support offerings (described further below); \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n hardware revenues, which include the sale of: hardware products including Oracle Engineered Systems, computer servers, and storage products, and\\nindustry-specific hardware; and hardware support revenues (described further below); and  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n services revenues, which are earned from providing cloud, software and hardware related services including consulting, advanced customer support and\\neducation services.  Revenues generally are recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to\\ngovernmental authorities.  Revenue Recognition for Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS Offerings, Hardware Products, Hardware Support and Related\\nServices (Non-software Elements)  Our revenue recognition policy for non-software deliverables including cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS\\nofferings, hardware products, hardware support and related services is based upon the accounting guidance contained in ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition, Multiple-Element Arrangements, and we exercise judgment and use estimates in\\nconnection with the determination of the amount of cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues, hardware products revenues, hardware support and related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period. \\n \\xa0 87 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2017  \\xa0\\n Revenues from the sales of our non-software elements are recognized when: (1)\\xa0persuasive evidence\\nof an arrangement exists; (2)\\xa0we deliver the products and passage of the title to the buyer occurs; (3)\\xa0the sale price is fixed or determinable; and (4)\\xa0collection is reasonably assured. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of\\nsale because the foregoing conditions are not met are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met.  Our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS\\nofferings generally provide customers access to certain of our software and/or infrastructure within a cloud-based IT environment that we manage, host and support and offer to customers on a subscription basis. Our cloud IaaS offerings also include\\ndeployment and management services for software and hardware and related IT infrastructure. Revenues for our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings are generally recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date the service is made\\navailable to customers and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied.  Revenues from the sale of hardware products represent\\namounts earned primarily from the sale of our Oracle Engineered Systems, computer servers, storage, and industry-specific hardware and are recognized upon the delivery of the hardware product to the customer provided all other revenue recognition\\ncriteria have been satisfied.  Our hardware support offerings generally provide customers with software updates for the software components\\nthat are essential to the functionality of our hardware products and can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products\\nfees. Hardware support contracts are entered into at the customer\\x92s option and are recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangements, which is typically one year, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been\\nsatisfied.  Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements\\x97Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS Offerings, Hardware Products, Hardware\\nSupport and Related Services (Non-software Arrangements)  We enter into arrangements with customers that purchase non-software related\\nproducts and services from us at the same time, or within close proximity of one another (referred to as non-software multiple-element arrangements). Each element within a non-software multiple-element arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit\\nof accounting provided the following criteria are met: the delivered products or services have value to the customer on a standalone basis; and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered products or\\nservices, delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service is considered probable and is substantially controlled by us. We consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by us or another\\nvendor or could be resold by the customer. Further, our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products. Where the aforementioned criteria for a separate unit of accounting are not met, the\\ndeliverable is combined with the undelivered element(s) and treated as a single unit of accounting for the purposes of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition. For those units of accounting that include more than one\\ndeliverable but are treated as a single unit of accounting, we generally recognize revenues over the contractual period of the arrangement, or in the case of our cloud offerings, we generally recognize revenues over the contractual term of the cloud\\nsoftware subscription. For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we allocate revenue to the respective revenue line items within our consolidated statements of operations based\\non a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of relative selling prices of such elements.  For our non-software\\nmultiple-element arrangements, we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangement\\x92s inception. The selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy: VSOE if available,\\nthird-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE are available (a description as to how we determine VSOE, TPE and ESP is provided below). If a tangible hardware product includes software,\\nwe determine whether the tangible hardware product and the software work together to deliver the product\\x92s essential functionality and, if so, the \\n \\xa0 88 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2017  \\xa0\\n \\nentire product is treated as a non-software deliverable. The total arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the non-software deliverables using the\\nrelative selling prices of each unit based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. We limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional products or services or\\nmeeting of any specified performance conditions.  When possible, we establish VSOE of selling price for deliverables in software and\\nnon-software multiple-element arrangements using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and for software license updates and product support and hardware support, based on the renewal rates offered to customers. TPE is established\\nby evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated customers. If we are unable to determine the selling price because VSOE or TPE does not exist, we determine ESP for the\\npurposes of allocating the arrangement by reviewing historical transactions, including transactions whereby the deliverable was sold on a standalone basis and considering several other external and internal factors including, but not limited to,\\npricing practices including discounting, margin objectives, competition, contractually stated prices, the geographies in which we offer our products and services, the type of customer (i.e., distributor, value-added reseller, government agency and\\ndirect end user, among others) and the stage of the product lifecycle. The determination of ESP is made through consultation with and approval by our management, taking into consideration our pricing model and go-to-market strategy. As our, or our\\ncompetitors\\x92, pricing and go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes to our determination of VSOE, TPE and ESP. As a result, our future revenue recognition for\\nmultiple-element arrangements could differ materially from our results in the current period. Selling prices are analyzed on an annual basis or more frequently if we experience significant changes in our selling prices. \\nRevenue Recognition for Software Products and Software Related Services (Software Elements) \\nNew software licenses revenues primarily represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database, middleware, applications and\\nindustry-specific software products and exclude cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues and revenues derived from software license updates, which are included in software license updates and product support revenues. The basis for our new software\\nlicenses revenue recognition is substantially governed by the accounting guidance contained in ASC 985-605, Software\\x97Revenue Recognition. We exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of\\nsoftware and software related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period.  For software license arrangements that do not\\nrequire significant modification or customization of the underlying software, we recognize new software licenses revenues when: (1)\\xa0we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software; (2)\\xa0we deliver the\\nproducts; (3)\\xa0the sale price is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties; and (4)\\xa0collection is probable. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not\\nmet, are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met.  Substantially all of our software license arrangements do not include\\nacceptance provisions. However, if acceptance provisions exist as part of public policy (for example, in agreements with government entities where acceptance periods are required by law, or within previously executed terms and conditions that are\\nreferenced in the current agreement and are short-term in nature), we generally recognize revenues upon delivery provided the acceptance terms are perfunctory and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. If acceptance provisions are not\\nperfunctory (for example, acceptance provisions that are long-term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement), revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance\\nperiod.  The vast majority of our software license arrangements include software license updates and product support contracts, which are\\nentered into at the customer\\x92s option, and the related fees are recognized ratably over the \\n \\xa0 89 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2017  \\xa0\\n \\nterm of the arrangement, typically one year. Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the\\nterm of the support period. Product support includes internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel. Software license updates and product support contracts are generally priced as a\\npercentage of the net new software licenses fees and are generally invoiced in full at the beginning of the support term. Substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually. \\nRevenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements\\x97Software Products, Software Support and Software Related Services (Software Arrangements)\\n We often enter into arrangements with customers that purchase both software related products, software support and software related\\nservices from us at the same time, or within close proximity of one another (referred to as software related multiple-element arrangements). Such software related multiple-element arrangements include the sale of our software products, software\\nlicense updates and product support contracts and other software related services whereby software license delivery is followed by the subsequent or contemporaneous delivery of the other elements. For those software related multiple-element\\narrangements, we have applied the residual method to determine the amount of new software license revenues to be recognized pursuant to ASC 985-605. Under the residual method, if fair value exists for undelivered elements in a multiple-element\\narrangement, such fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred with the remaining portion of the arrangement consideration generally recognized upon delivery of the software license. We allocate the fair value of each element of a software\\nrelated multiple-element arrangement based upon its fair value as determined by our vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE\\x97described further above), with any remaining amount allocated to the software license. \\nRevenue Recognition Policies Applicable to both Software and Non-software Elements  Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements\\x97Arrangements with Software and Non-software Elements  We also enter into multiple-element arrangements that may include a combination of our various software related and non-software related products and services offerings including new software licenses,\\nsoftware license updates and product support, cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, hardware products, hardware support, consulting, advanced customer support services and education. In such arrangements, we first allocate the total arrangement\\nconsideration based on the relative selling prices of the software group of elements as a whole and to the non-software elements. We then further allocate consideration within the software group to the respective elements within that group following\\nthe guidance in ASC 985-605 and our policies as described above. In addition, we allocate the consideration within the non-software group to each respective element within that group based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangement\\x92s\\ninception as described above. After the arrangement consideration has been allocated to the software group of elements and non-software group of elements, we account for each respective element in the arrangement as described above and below.\\n Other Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to Software and Non-software Elements \\nMany of our software arrangements include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts and are included as a\\npart of our services business. Consulting revenues from these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from new software licenses revenues because the arrangements qualify as services transactions as defined in ASC 985-605. The more\\nsignificant factors considered in determining whether the revenues should be accounted for separately include the nature of services (i.e., consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product), degree of\\nrisk, availability of services from other vendors, timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance \\n \\xa0 90 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2017  \\xa0\\n \\ncriteria on the realizability of the software license fee. Revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed. If there is significant uncertainty about the\\nproject completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services, revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved. We estimate the proportional performance on contracts with fixed or \\x93not to exceed\\x94 fees on a\\nmonthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project. If we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion, revenues are recognized when we receive final acceptance\\nfrom the customer that the services have been completed. When total cost estimates exceed revenues, we accrue for the estimated losses immediately using cost estimates that are based upon an average fully burdened daily rate applicable to the\\nconsulting organization delivering the services. The complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affects the\\namounts of revenues and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements. A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing\\nrequirement changes.  Our advanced customer support services are offered as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers\\nbuying other software and non-software products and services. We offer these advanced support services, both on-premise and remote, to Oracle customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their products and services. Depending\\nupon the nature of the arrangement, revenues from these services are recognized as the services are performed or ratably over the term of the service period, which is generally one year or less. \\nEducation revenues are also a part of our services business and include instructor-led, media-based and internet-based training in the use of our cloud,\\nsoftware and hardware products. Education revenues are recognized as the classes or other education offerings are delivered.  If an arrangement\\ncontains multiple elements and does not qualify for separate accounting for the product and service transactions, then new software licenses revenues and/or hardware products revenues, including the costs of hardware products, are generally\\nrecognized together with the services based on contract accounting using either the percentage-of-completion or completed-contract method.  We\\nalso evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing \\x93fiscal funding\\x94 or \\x93termination for convenience\\x94 provisions, when such provisions are required by law, to determine the probability of possible cancellation. We\\nconsider multiple factors, including the history with the customer in similar transactions, the \\x93essential use\\x94 of the software or hardware products and the planning, budgeting and approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity.\\nIf we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is remote, we then recognize revenues once all of the criteria described above have been met. If such a determination cannot be made, revenues are recognized\\nupon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity.  We assess whether fees are fixed\\nor determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenues if all other revenue recognition requirements are met. Our standard payment terms are net 30 days. However, payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed. We\\nevaluate non-standard payment terms based on whether we have successful collection history on comparable arrangements (based upon similarity of customers, products, and license economics) and, if so, generally conclude such payment terms are fixed\\nand determinable and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition.  While most of our arrangements for sales within our\\nbusinesses include short-term payment terms, we have a standard practice of providing long-term financing to creditworthy customers primarily through our financing division. Since fiscal 1989, when our financing division was formed, we have\\nestablished a history of collection, without concessions, on these receivables with payment terms that generally extend up to five years from the contract date.

We have generally sold receivables financed through our\\nfinancing division on a non-recourse basis to third-party financing institutions within 90 days of the contracts\\x92 dates of execution and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated\\nstatements of cash flows. We account for the sales of these receivables as \\x93true sales\\x94 as defined in ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing, as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. We sold $1.6\\nbillion of our financing receivables to financial institutions during fiscal 2017 and $1.8 billion during each of fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Our customers include several of our suppliers and, occasionally, we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendors at or about the same time that we have sold our products to\\nthese same companies (Concurrent Transactions). Software license agreements, sales of hardware or sales of services that occur within a three-month time period from the date we have purchased goods or services from that same customer are reviewed\\nfor appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure. When we acquire goods or services from a customer, we negotiate the purchase separately from any sales transaction, at terms we consider to be at arm\\x92s length and settle the purchase in cash.\\nWe recognize revenues from Concurrent Transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are met and the goods and services acquired are necessary for our current operations.  Business Combinations  We apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, in\\naccounting for our acquisitions. It requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration\\ntransferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as\\nwell as any contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the\\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent\\nadjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations.  Costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company\\nor our internal operations are accounted for as termination and exit costs pursuant to ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations, and are accounted for separately from the business combination. A liability for costs associated with an exit\\nor disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred. When estimating the fair value of facility restructuring activities, assumptions are\\napplied regarding estimated sub-lease payments to be received, which can differ materially from actual results. This may require us to revise our initial estimates which may materially affect our results of operations and financial position in the\\nperiod the revision is made.  For a given acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may\\nextend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets\\nacquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts.  If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a\\npre-acquisition contingency (non-income tax related) by the end of the measurement period, which is generally the case given the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (1)\\xa0it\\nis probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and (2)\\xa0the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent to the measurement period, changes in our estimates of such\\ncontingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position. \\n \\xa0 92 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2017  \\xa0\\n In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a\\nbusiness combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded\\nto goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance\\x92s or contingency\\x92s estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax\\npositions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. \\nMarketable and Non-Marketable Securities \\nIn accordance with ASC 320, Investments\\x97Debt and Equity Securities, and based on our intentions regarding these instruments, we\\nclassify substantially all of our marketable debt and equity securities as available-for-sale. Marketable debt and equity securities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value, with all unrealized gains (losses) reflected net of tax\\nin stockholders\\x92 equity on our consolidated balance sheets, and as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. If we determine that an investment has an other than temporary decline in fair value, we recognize the\\ninvestment loss in non-operating income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. We periodically evaluate our investments to determine if impairment charges are required. Substantially all of our marketable debt and equity\\ninvestments are classified as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.  We\\nhold investments in certain non-marketable equity securities in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence. These equity securities are recorded at cost and included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance\\nsheets. If based on the terms of our ownership of these non-marketable securities, we determine that we exercise significant influence on the entity to which these non-marketable securities relate, we apply the requirements of ASC 323,\\nInvestments\\x97Equity Method and Joint Ventures, to account for such investments. Our non-marketable securities are subject to periodic impairment reviews.  Fair Values of Financial Instruments  We apply the provisions of ASC 820, Fair Value\\nMeasurement (ASC 820), to our assets and liabilities that we are required to measure at fair value pursuant to other accounting standards, including our investments in marketable debt and equity securities and our derivative financial\\ninstruments.  The additional disclosures regarding our fair value measurements are included in Note 4. \\nAllowances for Doubtful Accounts  We\\nrecord allowances for doubtful accounts based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices. For those invoices not specifically reviewed, provisions are provided at differing rates, based upon the age of the receivable, the\\ncollection history associated with the geographic region that the receivable was recorded in and current economic trends. We write-off a receivable and charge it against its recorded allowance when we have exhausted our collection efforts without\\nsuccess.  Concentrations of Risk  Financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivatives and trade receivables. Our cash and\\ncash equivalents are generally held with large, diverse financial institutions worldwide to reduce the amount of exposure to any single financial institution. Investment policies have been implemented that limit purchases of marketable debt\\nsecurities to investment-grade securities. Our derivative contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standings and any exposure to counterparty credit-related losses in these contracts is\\n\\n \\xa0 93 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2017  \\xa0\\n \\nlargely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of these contracts fluctuates from contractually established\\nthresholds. We generally do not require collateral to secure accounts receivable. The risk with respect to trade receivables is mitigated by credit evaluations we perform on our customers, the short duration of our payment terms for the significant\\nmajority of our customer contracts and by the diversification of our customer base. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues in fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015.  We outsource the design, manufacturing, assembly and delivery of certain of our hardware products to a variety of companies, many of which are located outside the United States. Further, we have\\nsimplified our supply chain processes by reducing the number of third-party manufacturing partners and the number of locations where these third-party manufacturers build our hardware products. Any inability of these third-party manufacturing\\npartners to deliver the contracted services for our hardware products could adversely impact future operating results of our hardware business. \\nInventories  Inventories are stated at\\nthe lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost, which approximates actual cost, on a first-in, first-out basis. We evaluate our ending inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence. This evaluation\\nincludes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand within specific time horizons (generally six to nine months). Inventories in excess of future demand are written down and charged to hardware expenses. In addition, we\\nassess the impact of changing technology to our inventories and we write down inventories that are considered obsolete. At the point of loss recognition, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and\\ncircumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.  Other Receivables \\nOther receivables represent value-added tax and sales tax receivables associated with the sale of our products and services to third parties. Other\\nreceivables are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets and totaled $794 million and $816 million at May\\xa031, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Deferred Sales Commissions  We defer sales commission expenses associated with our cloud\\nSaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, and recognize the related expenses over the non-cancelable term of the related contracts, which are typically one to three years. Amortization of deferred sales commissions is included as a component of sales and\\nmarketing expenses in our consolidated statements of operations.  Property, Plant and Equipment \\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at the lower of cost or realizable value, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the\\nstraight-line method based on estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from one to 40 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the lease terms, as appropriate.\\nProperty, plant and equipment are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We did not recognize any significant property impairment charges\\nin fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015.  Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Impairment Assessments \\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired.\\nIntangible assets that are not considered to have an indefinite useful life are \\n \\xa0 94 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2017  \\xa0\\n \\namortized over their useful lives, which generally range from one to 10 years. Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or\\nchanges in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization.  The carrying amounts of our goodwill and intangible\\nassets are periodically reviewed for impairment (at least annually for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets) and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. Pursuant\\nto ASC 350, Intangibles\\x97Goodwill and Other, we can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting unit\\x92s goodwill for impairment or we can directly perform the two-step impairment test. Based on our qualitative\\nassessment, if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) to be less than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test will be performed. In the first step, we\\ncompare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform\\nfurther testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the\\nreporting unit\\x92s goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit\\x92s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. We did not recognize any goodwill impairment charges in fiscal\\n2017 or 2016. During fiscal 2015, we recognized a $186 million goodwill impairment loss related to our hardware business.  Recoverability of\\nfinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. Recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of\\nthe carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. We did not recognize any\\nintangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015.  Derivative Financial Instruments \\nDuring fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, we used derivative and non-derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency and interest rate risks (see\\nNote 11 below for additional information). We account for these instruments in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815), which requires that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or\\nliability measured at its fair value as of the reporting date. ASC 815 also requires that changes in our derivatives\\x92 fair values be recognized in earnings, unless specific hedge accounting and documentation criteria are met (i.e., the\\ninstruments are accounted for as hedges).  The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the\\nderivative and the resulting designation. For a derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge, loss or gain attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized in earnings in the period of change with a corresponding offset recorded to the\\nitem for which the risk is being hedged. For a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge, each reporting period we record the change in fair value on the effective portion of the derivative to accumulated other comprehensive loss in our\\nconsolidated balance sheets, and an amount is reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings to offset the earnings impact that is attributable to the risk being hedged. For the non-derivative financial instrument designated\\nas a net investment hedge for our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries, the change on account of remeasurement of the effective portion for each reporting period is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in our\\nconsolidated balance sheets.  We perform the effectiveness testing of our aforementioned designated hedges on a quarterly basis and the changes\\nin ineffective portions of the derivatives, if any, are recognized immediately in earnings. \\n \\xa0 95 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2017  \\xa0\\n Legal Contingencies  We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. A description of our accounting\\npolicies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under \\x93Business Combinations\\x94 above. For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination or related to income taxes,\\nwe accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Note 18 below provides additional information regarding certain of our legal\\ncontingencies.  Shipping and Handling Costs  Our shipping and handling costs for hardware products sales are included in hardware expenses for all periods presented.  Foreign Currency  We transact business in various foreign currencies. In general, the\\nfunctional currency of a foreign operation is the local country\\x92s currency. Consequently, revenues and expenses of operations outside the United States are translated into U.S. Dollars using weighted-average exchange rates while assets and\\nliabilities of operations outside the United States are translated into U.S. Dollars using exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The effects of foreign currency translation adjustments are included in stockholders\\x92 equity as a component of\\naccumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and related periodic movements are summarized as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Net foreign exchange transaction losses\\nincluded in non-operating income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $152 million, $110 million and $157 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Stock-Based Compensation  We account for share-based payments to employees, including\\ngrants of service-based restricted stock awards, performance-based restricted stock awards (PSUs), service-based employee stock options, and purchases under employee stock purchase plans, in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation\\x97Stock\\nCompensation, which requires that share-based payments (to the extent they are compensatory) be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-09 in fiscal 2017 (see Note 1 above),\\nwe account for forfeitures as they occur. For our PSUs, we recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period for each separately vesting tranche, which is generally twelve months, as the performance\\nconditions to evaluate attainment of each tranche for each participant are independent of the performance conditions for the other tranches. The amount of stock-based compensation expense recorded as of the end of each annual reporting period is\\nbased on the actual attainment of performance targets. During our interim reporting periods, stock-based compensation expense is recorded based on expected attainment of performance targets. Changes in our estimates of the expected attainment of\\nperformance targets are reflected in the amount of stock-based compensation expense that we recognize for each PSU tranche on a cumulative basis during each interim reporting period in which such estimates are altered and may cause the amount of\\nstock-based compensation expense that we record for each interim reporting period to vary. For our service-based awards, we recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period of the award, which is generally\\nfour years.  We record deferred tax assets for stock-based compensation awards that result in deductions on certain of our income tax returns\\nbased on the amount of stock-based compensation recognized and the fair values attributable to the vested portion of stock awards assumed in connection with a business combination at the statutory tax rates in the jurisdictions that we are able to\\nrecognize such tax deductions. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-09 in fiscal 2017, the impacts of the actual tax deductions for stock-based awards that are realized in these jurisdictions are \\n \\xa0 96 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2017  \\xa0\\n \\ngenerally recognized in the reporting period that a restricted stock-based award vests or a stock option is exercised with any shortfall/windfall relative to the deferred tax asset established\\nrecorded as a discrete detriment/benefit to our provision for income taxes in such period.  Advertising \\nAll advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses, which were included within sales and marketing expenses, were $95 million, $68\\nmillion and $55 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Research and Development and Software Development Costs\\n All research and development costs are expensed as incurred.  Software development costs required to be capitalized under ASC 985-20, Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased or Marketed, and under ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software, were not material to\\nour consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015.

Deferred income taxes are recorded for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets\\nand liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts recognized for income tax purposes. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized.\\n A two-step approach is applied pursuant to ASC 740 in the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken\\nin a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes.\\nThe second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our provision for income taxes line\\nof our consolidated statements of operations.

Under the amendments in ASU 2017-04, an entity should recognize\\nan impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. ASU 2017-04 is effective for\\nus in our first quarter of fiscal 2021 on a prospective basis, and earlier adoption is permitted for goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January\\xa01, 2017.

We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements, and we currently expect\\nthat most of our operating lease commitments will be subject to the new standard and recognized as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets upon our adoption of ASU 2016-02, which will increase our total assets and total liabilities that\\nwe report relative to such amounts prior to adoption.  Revenue Recognition:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In May 2014, the FASB issued\\nASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606 and issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance in August 2015,\\xa0March 2016,\\xa0April 2016,\\xa0May 2016 and December 2016 within ASU 2015-14, ASU\\xa02016-08, ASU\\n2016-10, ASU 2016-12 and ASU 2016-20, respectively (ASU 2014-09, ASU 2015-14, ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10, ASU 2016-12 and ASU\\xa02016-20, respectively, and collectively Topic 606).\\xa0Topic 606 supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition\\nguidance under GAAP. The core principle of Topic 606 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services.\\nTopic 606 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing GAAP, including identifying\\nperformance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation, among others. Topic 606 also provides guidance\\non the recognition of costs related to obtaining customer contracts. Topic 606 is effective for us as of either our first quarter of fiscal 2018 or our first quarter of fiscal 2019 using either of two methods: (1)\\xa0retrospective application of\\nTopic 606 to each prior reporting period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients as defined within Topic\\xa0606 or (2)\\xa0retrospective application of Topic 606 with the cumulative effect of initially applying Topic 606\\nrecognized at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures as defined per Topic\\xa0606.\\xa0The accounting for the recognition of costs related to obtaining customer contracts under Topic 606 is significantly\\ndifferent than our current capitalization policy. The adoption of Topic 606 will result in additional types of costs that will be capitalized. Additionally, all amounts capitalized will be amortized over a period longer than our current policy.\\nPreliminarily, we plan to adopt Topic 606 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 pursuant to the aforementioned adoption method (1)\\xa0and we do not believe there will be a material impact to our revenues upon adoption.\\xa0We are continuing to\\nevaluate the impact to our revenues related to our pending adoption of Topic 606 and our preliminary assessments are subject to change.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n2.\\nACQUISITIONS  Fiscal 2017 Acquisitions\\n Acquisition of NetSuite Inc., a Related Party  On July\\xa028, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement) with NetSuite Inc. (NetSuite), a provider of cloud-based enterprise resource planning (ERP) software and related\\napplications and, as described further below, a related party to Oracle.  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we commenced a tender offer on\\nAugust\\xa018, 2016 to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of NetSuite common stock (NetSuite Shares) at a purchase price of $109.00 per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest thereon, based upon the terms and subject to\\nthe conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase dated August\\xa018, 2016, and in the related Letter of Transmittal. On November\\xa07, \\n \\xa0 99 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2017  \\xa0\\n \\n2016, pursuant to the terms of the tender offer and applicable Delaware law, we accepted and paid for the substantial majority of outstanding NetSuite Shares and effectuated the merger of\\nNetSuite with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oracle and NetSuite became an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Oracle. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, NetSuite Shares that remained outstanding and were not acquired by us were converted\\ninto, and cancelled in exchange for, the right to receive $109.00 per share in cash. The unvested equity awards to acquire NetSuite Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the conclusion of the merger were converted into equity awards\\ndenominated in shares of Oracle common stock based on formulas contained in the Merger Agreement. We acquired NetSuite to, among other things, expand our cloud software as a service offerings with a complementary set of cloud ERP and related cloud\\nsoftware applications for customers. We have included the financial results of NetSuite in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.  Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracle\\x92s Chairman of the Board and Chief Technology Officer and Oracle\\x92s largest stockholder, is an affiliate of NetSuite\\x92s largest stockholder, NetSuite Restricted\\nHoldings LLC (a single member LLC investment entity whose interests are beneficially owned by a trust controlled by Mr.\\xa0Ellison), which owned approximately 40% of the issued and outstanding NetSuite Shares immediately prior to the conclusion of\\nthe merger. Oracle\\x92s Board of Directors appointed a Special Committee (comprised solely of directors who are independent of the management of Oracle, Mr.\\xa0Ellison, his family members and any affiliated entities, and NetSuite) to which it\\ndelegated the full and exclusive power, authority and discretion of the Board to evaluate, assess, and approve the NetSuite transaction on its behalf. The Special Committee engaged its own independent legal counsel and its own independent financial\\nadvisor to advise it on the transaction. The financial advisor provided the Special Committee with a fairness opinion in connection with the transaction. After extensive deliberations, the Special Committee concluded that the transaction terms were\\nfair to Oracle and the transaction was in the best interests of Oracle and its stockholders. The Special Committee unanimously approved the transaction on behalf of Oracle and the Board.  The total preliminary purchase price for NetSuite was approximately $9.1 billion, which consisted of approximately $9.0 billion in cash and $78 million for the fair values of restricted stock-based awards\\nand stock options assumed. Pursuant to our business combinations accounting policy, we estimated the preliminary fair values of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, and the excess of the consideration transferred over the aggregate of such\\nfair values was recorded as goodwill. The preliminary fair values of net tangible assets and intangible assets acquired were based on preliminary valuations, and our estimates and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period (up\\nto one year from the acquisition date). The primary areas that remain preliminary relate to the fair values of intangible assets acquired, certain tangible assets and liabilities acquired, certain legal matters, income and non-income based taxes and\\nresidual goodwill. We expect to continue to obtain information to assist us in determining the fair values of the net assets acquired during the measurement period.

Other Fiscal 2017 Acquisitions  During fiscal 2017, we acquired certain companies and purchased certain technology and development assets primarily to expand our products and services offerings. These acquisitions were not individually\\nor in the aggregate significant. We have included the financial results of the acquired companies in our consolidated financial statements from their respective acquisition dates, and the results from each of these companies were not individually\\nmaterial to our consolidated financial statements. In the aggregate, the total preliminary purchase price for these acquisitions was approximately $3.0 billion, which consisted of approximately $3.0 billion in cash and $12\\xa0million for the fair\\nvalues of restricted stock-based awards and stock options assumed. We preliminarily recorded $153 million of net tangible assets and $1.0 billion of identifiable intangible assets, based on their estimated fair values, and $1.8 billion of residual\\ngoodwill.  The preliminary fair value estimates for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for our acquisitions completed during fiscal\\n2017 were based upon preliminary calculations and valuations, and our estimates and assumptions for these acquisitions are subject to change as we obtain additional information during the respective measurement periods (up to one year from the\\nrespective acquisition dates). The primary areas of those preliminary estimates that are not yet finalized relate to certain tangible assets and liabilities acquired, identifiable intangible assets, certain legal matters, income and non-income based\\ntaxes and residual goodwill.  Fiscal 2016 Acquisitions  During fiscal 2016, we acquired certain companies and purchased certain technology and development assets primarily to expand our products and services offerings. These acquisitions were not significant\\nindividually or in the aggregate.  Fiscal 2015 Acquisitions  Acquisition of MICROS Systems, Inc.  On September\\xa08, 2014, we completed our\\nacquisition of MICROS Systems, Inc. (MICROS), a provider of integrated software, hardware and services solutions to the hospitality and retail industries, by means of a merger of one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries with and into MICROS such that\\nMICROS became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oracle. We acquired MICROS to, among other things, expand our cloud and on-premise software, hardware and related services offerings for hotels, food and beverage industries, facilities, and retailers. We\\nhave included the financial results of MICROS in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.  The total purchase price\\nfor MICROS was $5.2 billion which consisted of $5.2 billion in cash paid to acquire the outstanding common stock of MICROS and $6 million for the fair value of restricted stock-based awards and stock options assumed. In allocating the purchase price\\nbased on estimated fair values, we recorded approximately $3.2 billion of goodwill, $2.0 billion of identifiable intangible assets and $25 million of net tangible liabilities.  Other Fiscal 2015 Acquisitions  During fiscal 2015, we acquired certain other\\ncompanies and purchased certain technology and development assets primarily to expand our products and services offerings.

Our investment portfolio is subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. As described above, we limit purchases of marketable debt securities to\\ninvestment-grade securities, which have high credit ratings and also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer.

ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When\\ndetermining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at their fair values, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and consider assumptions that market participants would\\nuse when pricing the assets or liabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance.  ASC 820 establishes a\\nfair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. An asset\\x92s or a liability\\x92s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is\\nbased upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: \\n \\xa0 103\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2017  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Level 2: inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or\\nliabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or\\nliabilities; or  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Level 3: unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair values of the assets or\\nliabilities.

Refer to\\nNotes 1 and 11 for a description of our accounting for fair value hedges.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n(2)\\xa0\\n In July 2013, we issued \\x802.0 billion of fixed-rate senior notes comprised of \\x801.25 billion of 2.25% senior notes due January\\n2021\\xa0(January 2021 Notes) and \\x80750\\xa0million of 3.125% senior notes due July 2025 (July 2025 Notes, and together with the January 2021 Notes, the Euro Notes). Principal and unamortized discount/issuance costs for the Euro Notes in the\\ntable above were calculated using foreign currency exchange rates as of May\\xa031, 2017 and May\\xa031, 2016, respectively. The Euro Notes are registered and trade on the New\\xa0York Stock Exchange. \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n(3)\\xa0\\n In connection with the issuance of the January 2021 Notes, we entered into certain cross-currency swap agreements that have the economic effect of\\nconverting our fixed-rate, Euro-denominated debt, including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate, U.S.\\xa0Dollar-denominated debt of $1.6 billion with a fixed annual interest rate of 3.53% (see Note 11\\nfor additional information).  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n(4)\\xa0\\n We designated the July 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their\\nfunctional currency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholders\\x92 equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the U.S.\\xa0Dollar (see Note 11 for additional information).\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n(5)\\xa0\\n In July 2016, we issued $14.0 billion of senior notes for general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on\\nour common stock and repayment of indebtedness and future acquisitions. The interest is payable semi-annually. We may redeem some or all of the senior notes of each series prior to their maturity, subject to certain restrictions, and the payment of\\nan applicable make-whole premium in certain instances.  Future principal payments (adjusted for the effects of the\\ncross-currency swap agreements associated with the January 2021 Notes) for all of our borrowings at May\\xa031, 2017 were as follows (in millions):  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Fiscal 2018\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n9,800\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Fiscal 2019\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2,000\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Fiscal 2020\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n4,500\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Fiscal 2021\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2,395\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Fiscal 2022\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n8,250\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Thereafter\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n31,200\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Total\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa058,145\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n Senior Notes  Interest is payable semi-annually for the senior notes except for the Euro Notes for which interest is payable annually and the floating-rate senior notes for which interest is payable quarterly. We may\\nredeem some or all of the senior notes of each series prior to their maturity, subject to certain restrictions, and the payment of an applicable make-whole premium in certain instances except for the floating-rate senior notes which may not be\\nredeemed prior to their maturity.  The senior notes rank pari passu with any other notes we may issue in the future pursuant to our commercial\\npaper program (see additional discussion regarding our commercial paper program below) and all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness of Oracle Corporation. All existing and future liabilities of the subsidiaries of Oracle Corporation are\\nor will be effectively senior to the senior notes and any future issuances of commercial paper notes. We were in compliance with all debt-related covenants at May\\xa031, 2017.  Revolving Credit Agreements  In May 2017, we entered into four revolving credit agreements\\nwith JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as initial lender and administrative agent (the 2017 Credit Agreements) and borrowed $3.8 billion pursuant to these agreements. The 2017 Credit Agreements provided us with short-term borrowings for working capital and\\nother general corporate purposes. Interest for the 2017 Credit Agreements is based on either (1)\\xa0a LIBOR-based formula or (2)\\xa0the Base Rate formula, each as set forth in the 2017 Credit Agreements. The borrowings are due and payable on\\nJune\\xa029, 2017, which is the termination date of the 2017 Credit Agreements. \\n \\xa0 108\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2017  \\xa0\\n In May 2016, we borrowed $3.8 billion pursuant to three revolving credit agreements with JPMorgan Chase\\nBank, N.A., as initial lender and administrative agent (the 2016 Credit Agreements). In June 2016, we repaid the $3.8 billion and the 2016 Credit Agreements expired pursuant to their terms.  In April 2013, we entered into a $3.0 billion Revolving Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Bank of America, N.A., BNP Paribas, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and certain other lenders (the 2013\\nCredit Agreement). The 2013 Credit Agreement provides for an unsecured 5-year revolving credit facility to be used for general corporate purposes including back-stopping any commercial paper notes that we may issue. Subject to certain conditions\\nstated in the 2013 Credit Agreement, we may borrow, prepay and re-borrow amounts under the 2013 Credit Agreement at any time during the term of the 2013 Credit Agreement. Interest under the 2013 Credit Agreement is based on either (a)\\xa0a\\nLIBOR-based formula or (b)\\xa0the Base Rate formula, each as set forth in the 2013 Credit Agreement. Any amounts drawn pursuant to the 2013 Credit Agreement are due on April\\xa020, 2018. No amounts were outstanding pursuant to the 2013 Credit\\nAgreement as of May\\xa031, 2017 and 2016.  The 2013 Credit Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties, covenants and\\nevents of default. If any of the events of default occur and are not cured within applicable grace periods or waived, any unpaid amounts owed under the agreement to which the default relates may be declared immediately due and payable and the\\nrelevant agreement may be terminated. We were in compliance with the 2013 Credit Agreement covenants as of May\\xa031, 2017.  Commercial\\nPaper Program and Commercial Paper Notes  In April 2013, pursuant to our existing $3.0 billion commercial paper program which allows us to\\nissue and sell unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a private placement exemption from the registration requirements under federal and state securities laws, we entered into new dealer agreements with various banks and a new Issuing and\\nPaying Agency Agreement with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A\\xa0(JP Morgan). Effective on December\\xa022, 2014, Deutsche Bank Trust Companies Americas became the Successor Issuing and Paying Agent replacing JP Morgan.\\xa0Since that time, we have\\nentered into new dealer agreements with additional banks. As of May\\xa031, 2017 and 2016, we did not have any outstanding commercial paper notes. We intend to back-stop any commercial paper notes that we may issue in the future with the 2013\\nCredit Agreement.  Other Borrowings Activities  In connection with our acquisition of NetSuite in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 (see Note 2 above), we assumed $310\\xa0million par value of legacy NetSuite convertible notes (NetSuite Debt), which\\nhad a fair value of $342 million as of the acquisition date.\\xa0Our acquisition of NetSuite triggered (a)\\xa0the right of holders of the NetSuite Debt to convert their debt holdings into an amount payable in cash, at any time through\\nDecember\\xa022, 2016, based upon conversion formulas that are contained within the NetSuite Debt indenture and (b)\\xa0the obligation of NetSuite to offer to repurchase the NetSuite Debt from each holder at a purchase price equal to par, plus\\naccrued and unpaid interest, which offer expired on December\\xa021, 2016. In December 2016, we repurchased and settled for cash substantially all of the NetSuite Debt.  In the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we assumed $113 million of debt that bears interest at 3.53% and matures in August 2025 in connection with our acquisition of certain land and buildings. \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n9.\\nRESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES  Fiscal 2017\\nOracle Restructuring Plan  During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, our management approved, committed to and initiated plans to\\nrestructure and further improve efficiencies in our operations due to our recent acquisitions and certain other operational activities (2017 Restructuring Plan). Our management subsequently supplemented the 2017 Restructuring Plan in the third\\nquarter of fiscal 2017 to reflect additional actions that we expect to take.

We recorded $486 million of restructuring expenses in connection with the 2017 Restructuring Plan in fiscal 2017 and we expect to incur the majority of the estimated remaining $403 million through the end of fiscal 2018. Any\\nchanges to the estimates of executing the 2017 Restructuring Plan will be reflected in our future results of operations.  Fiscal 2015\\nOracle Restructuring Plan  During the second quarter of fiscal 2015, our management approved, committed to and initiated plans to\\nrestructure and further improve efficiencies in our operations due to our acquisition of MICROS and certain other operational activities (2015 Restructuring Plan). Restructuring costs associated with the 2015 Restructuring Plan were recorded to the\\nrestructuring expense line item within our consolidated statements of operations as they were incurred. We recorded $462 million and $100 million of restructuring expenses in connection with the 2015 Restructuring Plan in fiscal 2016 and 2015,\\nrespectively.

We generally have estimated the fair values of these obligations assumed using a cost build-up approach. The cost\\nbuild-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. The sum of the costs and operating profit approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third\\nparty to assume these acquired obligations. These aforementioned fair value adjustments recorded for obligations assumed from our acquisitions reduced the cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, software license updates and product support and hardware deferred\\nrevenues balances that we recorded as liabilities from these acquisitions and also reduced the resulting revenues that we recognized or will recognize over the terms of the acquired obligations during the post-combination periods. \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n11.\\nDERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  Fair\\nValue Hedges\\x97Interest Rate Swap Agreements  In July 2014, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the\\neconomic effect of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with our October 2019 Notes and our July 2021 Notes so that the interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. In July 2013, we entered into\\ncertain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with our January 2019 Notes so that the interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. The\\ncritical terms of the interest rate swap agreements match the critical terms of the October 2019 Notes, July 2021 Notes and the January 2019 Notes that the interest rate swap agreements pertain to, including the notional amounts and maturity dates.\\n We have designated the aforementioned interest rate swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for them as fair\\nvalue hedges pursuant to ASC 815. These transactions are characterized as fair value hedges for financial accounting purposes because they protect us against changes in the fair values of certain of our fixed-rate borrowings due to benchmark\\ninterest rate movements. The changes in fair values of these interest rate swap agreements are recognized as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amounts included in other assets or other non-current\\nliabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of net gain (loss) attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amount included in notes\\npayable, non-current. The periodic interest settlements for the interest rate swap agreements for the October 2019 Notes, July 2021 Notes and the January 2019 Notes are recorded as interest expense and are included as a part of cash flows from\\noperating activities.  We do not use any interest rate swap agreements for trading purposes. \\nCash Flow Hedges\\x97Cross-Currency Swap Agreements  In connection with the issuance of our January 2021 Notes, we entered into certain cross-currency swap agreements to manage the related foreign currency exchange risk by effectively converting the\\nfixed-rate, Euro-denominated January 2021 Notes, including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to fixed-rate, U.S.\\xa0Dollar-denominated debt. The economic effect of the swap agreements was to eliminate the\\nuncertainty of the cash flows in U.S. Dollars associated with the January 2021 Notes by fixing the principal amount of the January 2021 Notes at $1.6 billion with a fixed annual interest rate of 3.53%. We have designated these cross-currency swap\\nagreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for these as cash flow hedges pursuant to ASC 815. The critical terms of the cross-currency swap agreements correspond to the January 2021 Notes, including the annual interest payments\\nbeing hedged, and the cross-currency swap agreements mature at the same time as the January 2021 Notes. \\n \\xa0 112\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2017  \\xa0\\n We used the hypothetical derivative method to measure the effectiveness of our cross-currency swap\\nagreements. The fair values of these cross-currency swap agreements are recognized as other assets or other non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The effective portions of the changes in fair values of these cross-currency swap\\nagreements are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets and an amount is reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss into non-operating income, net in the same period that the carrying value of\\nthe Euro-denominated January 2021 Notes is remeasured and the interest expense is recognized. The ineffective portion of the unrealized gains and losses on these cross-currency swaps, if any, is recorded immediately to non-operating income, net. We\\nevaluate the effectiveness of our cross-currency swap agreements on a quarterly basis. We did not record any ineffectiveness for fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015. The cash flows related to the cross-currency swap agreements that pertain to the periodic\\ninterest settlements are classified as operating activities and the cash flows that pertain to the principal balance are classified as financing activities.  We do not use any cross-currency swap agreements for trading purposes.  Net Investment\\nHedge\\x97Foreign Currency Borrowings  In July 2013, we designated our July 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge of our investments\\nin certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholders\\x92 equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the U.S.\\nDollar.  We used the spot method to measure the effectiveness of our net investment hedge. Under this method, for each reporting period, the\\nchange in the carrying value of the Euro-denominated July 2025 Notes due to remeasurement of the effective portion is reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet and the remaining change in the carrying value\\nof the ineffective portion, if any, is recognized in non-operating income, net in our consolidated statements of operations. We evaluate the effectiveness of our net investment hedge at the beginning of every quarter. We did not record any\\nineffectiveness for fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015.  Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as Hedges \\nWe transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the\\nrisks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or\\nlosses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions. We may suspend this program from time to time. Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from\\nintercompany sublicense fees, intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions that are generally expected to be cash settled in the near term. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. Our ultimate realized\\ngain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency exposures that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized\\nand unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors.  Neither do we use these\\nforeign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815. Accordingly, we recorded the fair values of these contracts as of the end of each reporting period to our\\nconsolidated balance sheets with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. The balance sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is prepaid expenses and other current assets for forward\\ncontracts in an unrealized gain position and other current liabilities for forward contracts in an unrealized loss position.

The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal at May\\xa031, 2017 and 2016.

We have approximately $53 million in facility obligations, net of estimated sublease income and other costs, in accrued restructuring for these locations in our consolidated balance sheet at\\nMay\\xa031, 2017.  Rent expense was $273 million, $283 million and $290 million for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, net of sublease\\nincome of approximately $87 million for fiscal 2017 and $45 million for each of fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. Certain lease agreements contain renewal options providing for extensions of the lease terms. \\nUnconditional Obligations  In the\\nordinary course of business, we enter into certain unconditional purchase obligations with our suppliers, which are agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and specify terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed,\\nminimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payment. We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for our hardware products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished hardware\\nproducts. We also obtain individual components for our hardware products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and\\ntypically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead-times and/or commercially standard lead-times for the particular part or product and have been included in the amounts below. Routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not\\nrelated to our external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in the ordinary course of business are not included in the amounts below, as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated\\nterms and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way.

Guarantees  Our cloud, software and hardware product sales agreements generally include\\ncertain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if our products infringe a third party\\x92s intellectual property rights. To date, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications and have not accrued\\nany material liabilities related to such obligations in our consolidated financial statements. Certain of our product sales agreements also include provisions indemnifying customers against liabilities in the event we breach confidentiality or\\nservice level requirements. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to our limited and infrequent history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved\\nin each particular agreement.  Our SaaS, PaaS and IaaS agreements generally include a warranty that the cloud services will be performed in all\\nmaterial respects as defined in the agreement during the service period. Our software license and hardware products agreements also generally include a warranty that our products will substantially operate as described in the applicable program\\ndocumentation for a period of one year after delivery. We also warrant that services we perform will be provided in a manner consistent with industry standards for a period of 90 days from performance of the services. \\nWe occasionally are required, for various reasons, to enter into\\xa0financial guarantees with third parties in\\xa0the ordinary course of our\\nbusiness\\xa0including, among others,\\xa0guarantees related to taxes, import licenses and letters of credit on behalf of parties with whom we conduct business. Such agreements have not had a material effect on our results of operations, financial\\nposition or cash flows.  In connection with certain litigation, we posted certain court-mandated surety bonds with a court and entered into\\nrelated indemnification agreements with each of the surety bond issuing companies. Additional information is provided in Note 18 below.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n13.\\nSTOCKHOLDERS\\x92 EQUITY  Common\\nStock Repurchases  Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. As of May\\xa031, 2017,\\napproximately $5.3 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 85.6\\xa0million shares for $3.5 billion (including 0.5\\xa0million shares for $23 million that were repurchased but not\\nsettled), 271.9\\xa0million shares for $10.4 billion and 193.7\\xa0million shares for $8.1 billion in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, under the stock repurchase program.  Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions\\nand dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1\\nplan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.  Dividends on Common Stock\\n During fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, our Board of Directors declared cash dividends of $0.64, $0.60 and $0.51 per share of our outstanding\\ncommon stock, respectively, which we paid during the same period. \\n \\xa0 116\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2017  \\xa0\\n In June 2017, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share of our\\noutstanding common stock.

Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are\\nsubject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.

In fiscal 2011, our\\nstockholders, upon the recommendation of our Board of Directors (the Board), approved the adoption of the Amended and Restated 2000 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the 2000 Plan), which extended the termination date of the 2000 Plan by 10 years and\\nincreased the number of authorized shares of stock that may be issued by 388,313,015 shares. In fiscal 2014, our stockholders, upon the recommendation of our Board, approved a further increase in the number of authorized shares of stock that may be\\nissued under the 2000 Plan by 305,000,000 shares. Under the terms of the 2000 Plan, long-term full value awards are granted in the form of restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance stock units (PSUs). The vesting schedule for RSUs is established\\nby the Compensation Committee and generally requires vesting 25% annually over four years. The vesting schedule for PSUs is also established by the Compensation Committee and currently requires achieving performance targets and providing service\\nover four fiscal years. Options to purchase common stock are granted at not less than fair market value, become exercisable as established by the Compensation Committee of the Board (generally 25% annually over four years under our current practice)\\nand generally expire no more than 10 years from the date of grant. For each share granted as a full value award under the 2000 Plan, an equivalent of 2.5 shares is deducted from our pool of shares available for grant. As of May\\xa031, 2017, the\\n2000 Plan had 68\\xa0million unvested RSUs outstanding, 6\\xa0million unvested PSUs outstanding and stock options to purchase 305\\xa0million shares of common stock outstanding of which 232\\xa0million shares were vested. As of May\\xa031,\\n2017, approximately 217\\xa0million shares of common stock were available for future awards under the 2000 Plan. To date, we have not issued any stock purchase rights or stock appreciation rights under the 2000 Plan. \\nIn fiscal 1993, the Board adopted the 1993 Directors\\x92 Stock Plan (the Directors\\x92 Plan), which provides for the issuance of RSUs and other\\nstock-based awards, including non-qualified stock options, to non-employee directors. The Directors\\x92 Plan has from time to time been amended and restated. Under the terms of the Directors\\x92 Plan, 10\\xa0million shares of common stock are\\nreserved for issuance (including a fiscal 2013 amendment \\n \\xa0 117\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2017  \\xa0\\n \\nto increase the number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance by 2\\xa0million shares). In prior years, we granted stock options at not less than fair market value, that vest over\\nfour years, and expire no more than 10\\xa0years from the date of grant. The Directors\\x92 Plan was most recently amended on April\\xa029, 2016 and permits the Compensation Committee of the Board to determine the amount and form of automatic\\ngrants of stock awards to each non-employee director upon first becoming a director and thereafter on an annual basis, as well as automatic nondiscretionary grants for chairing certain Board committees, subject to certain stockholder approved\\nlimitations set forth in the Directors\\x92 Plan. As of May\\xa031, 2017, approximately 110,000 unvested RSUs and stock options to purchase approximately 2\\xa0million shares of common stock (of which approximately 1\\xa0million were vested)\\nwere outstanding under the Directors\\x92 Plan. As of May\\xa031, 2017, approximately 2\\xa0million shares were available for future stock awards under this plan.  In connection with certain of our acquisitions, we assumed certain outstanding restricted stock-based awards and stock options under each acquired company\\x92s respective stock plans.

As of\\nMay\\xa031, 2017, 51\\xa0million shares were reserved for future issuances under the Purchase Plan. We issued 3\\xa0million shares in each of fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, under the Purchase Plan. \\nDefined Contribution and Other Postretirement Plans  We offer various defined contribution plans for our U.S. and non-U.S. employees. Total defined contribution plan expense was $366 million, $387 million and $362 million for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015,\\nrespectively. The number of plan participants in our benefit plans has generally increased in recent years as we have hired additional employees and assumed eligible employees from our acquisitions. \\nIn the United States, regular employees can participate in the Oracle Corporation 401(k) Savings and Investment Plan (Oracle 401(k) Plan). Participants\\ncan generally contribute up to 40% of their eligible compensation on a per-pay-period basis as defined by the Oracle 401(k) Plan document or by the section 402(g) limit as defined by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). We match a portion of\\nemployee contributions, currently 50% up to 6% of compensation each pay period, subject to maximum aggregate matching amounts. Our contributions to the Oracle 401(k) Plan, net of forfeitures, were $157 million, $153 million and $144 million in\\nfiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  We also offer non-qualified deferred compensation plans to certain employees whereby they may defer\\na portion of their annual base and/or variable compensation until retirement or a date specified by the employee in accordance with the plans. Deferred compensation plan assets and liabilities were each approximately $487\\xa0million as of\\nMay\\xa031, 2017 and were each approximately $419 million as of May\\xa031, 2016 and were presented in other assets and other non-current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. \\nWe sponsor certain defined benefit pension plans that are offered primarily by certain of our foreign subsidiaries. Many of these plans were assumed\\nthrough our acquisitions or are required by local regulatory requirements. We may deposit funds for these plans with insurance companies, third-party trustees, or into government-managed accounts consistent with local regulatory requirements, as\\napplicable. Our total defined benefit plan pension expenses were $85 million, $95 million and $69 million for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The aggregate projected benefit obligation and aggregate net liability (funded status) of our\\ndefined benefit plans as of May\\xa031, 2017 was $1.1 billion and $712 million, respectively, and as of

undistributed earnings and the other outside basis temporary differences\\nof foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. At May\\xa031, 2017, the amount of temporary differences related to undistributed earnings and other outside basis temporary differences of\\ninvestments in foreign subsidiaries upon which United States income taxes have not been provided was approximately $47.5 billion and $7.9 billion, respectively. If these undistributed earnings were repatriated to the United States, or if the other\\noutside basis differences were recognized in a taxable transaction, they would generate foreign tax credits that would reduce the federal tax liability associated with the foreign dividend or the otherwise taxable transaction. At May\\xa031, 2017,\\nassuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits, the potential net deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences of undistributed earnings and other outside basis temporary differences would be approximately $15.1 billion\\nand $2.6 billion, respectively.  Our net deferred tax assets were $683 million and $1.1 billion as of May\\xa031, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\\nWe believe that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generation of sufficient taxable income in future years in\\nappropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future\\nperiods if estimates of future taxable income change.  The valuation allowance was $1.2 billion and $1.2 billion at each of May\\xa031, 2017\\nand 2016, respectively. Substantially all of the valuation allowances as of May\\xa031, 2017 and 2016 relate to tax assets established in purchase accounting. Any subsequent reduction of that portion of the valuation allowance and the recognition\\nof the associated tax benefits associated with our acquisitions will be recorded to our provision for income taxes \\n \\xa0 123\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2017  \\xa0\\n \\nsubsequent to our final determination of the valuation allowance or the conclusion of the measurement period (as defined above), whichever comes first. \\nAt May\\xa031, 2017, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1.6 billion. These losses expire in various years between fiscal\\n2018 and fiscal 2036 and are subject to limitations on their utilization. We had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $2.4 billion at May\\xa031, 2017, which expire between fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2037 and are subject to\\nlimitations on their utilization. We had total foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1.9 billion at May\\xa031, 2017, which are subject to limitations on their utilization. Approximately $1.7 billion of these foreign net\\noperating losses are not currently subject to expiration dates. The remainder of the foreign net operating losses, approximately $187 million, expire between fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2037. We had tax credit carryforwards of approximately $1.8 billion\\nat May\\xa031, 2017, which are subject to limitations on their utilization. Approximately $696 million of these tax credit carryforwards are not currently subject to expiration dates. The remainder of the tax credit carryforwards, approximately\\n$1.1 billion, expire in various years between fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2038.  We classify our unrecognized tax benefits as either current or\\nnon-current income taxes payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The aggregate changes in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits, including acquisitions, were as follows: \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nYear Ended May\\xa031,\\n\\xa0\\n\\n (in millions)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2017\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2016\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2015\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Gross unrecognized tax benefits as of June\\xa01\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n4,561\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n4,038\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n3,838\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Increases related to tax positions from prior fiscal years\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n128\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n350\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n119\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Decreases related to tax positions from prior fiscal years\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(218\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(111\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(17\\n)\\xa0\\n\\n Increases related to tax positions taken during current fiscal year\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n595\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n461\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n316\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Settlements with tax authorities\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(85\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(73\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(30\\n)\\xa0\\n\\n Lapses of statutes of limitation\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(47\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(73\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(54\\n)\\xa0\\n\\n Cumulative translation adjustments and other, net\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(15\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(31\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(134\\n)\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Total gross unrecognized tax benefits as of May\\xa031\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa04,919\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa04,561\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa04,038\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n As of May\\xa031, 2017, 2016 and 2015, $3.4 billion, $3.1 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, of unrecognized tax\\nbenefits would affect our effective tax rate if recognized. We recognized interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our provision for income taxes line of our consolidated statements of operations of $125 million, $26 million and\\n$102 million during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Interest and penalties accrued as of May\\xa031, 2017 and 2016 were $885 million and $765 million, respectively.  Domestically, U.S. federal and state taxing authorities are currently examining income tax returns of Oracle and various acquired entities for years through fiscal 2016. Many issues are at an advanced\\nstage in the examination process, the most significant of which include the deductibility of certain royalty payments, transfer pricing, extraterritorial income exemptions, domestic production activity, foreign tax credits, and research and\\ndevelopment credits taken. With all of these domestic audit issues considered in the aggregate, we believe that it was reasonably possible that, as of May\\xa031, 2017, the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to these audits could decrease\\n(whether by payment, release, or a combination of both) in the next 12 months by as much as $389 million ($336 million net of offsetting tax benefits). Our U.S. federal income tax returns have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2007 and we\\nare no longer subject to audit for those periods. Our U.S. state income tax returns, with some exceptions, have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2004, and we are no longer subject to audit for those periods. \\nInternationally, tax authorities for numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions are also examining returns affecting our unrecognized tax benefits. We believe that\\nit was reasonably possible that, as of May\\xa031, 2017, the gross unrecognized tax benefits, could decrease (whether by payment, release, or a combination of both) by as much as \\n \\xa0 124\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2017  \\xa0\\n \\n$152 million ($78 million net of offsetting tax benefits) in the next 12 months, related primarily to transfer pricing. With some exceptions, we are generally no longer subject to tax\\nexaminations in non-U.S. jurisdictions for years prior to fiscal 1997.  We believe that we have adequately provided under GAAP for outcomes\\nrelated to our tax audits. However, there can be no assurances as to the possible outcomes or any related financial statement effect thereof. On July\\xa027, 2015, in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion related\\nto the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement. A final decision has yet to be issued by the Tax Court due to other outstanding issues related to the case. At this time, the U.S. Department of the\\nTreasury has not withdrawn the requirement to include stock-based compensation from its regulations. We have reviewed this case and its impact on Oracle and concluded that no adjustment to the consolidated financial statements is appropriate at this\\ntime. We will continue to monitor ongoing developments and potential impacts to our consolidated financial statements.  We are under audit by\\nthe IRS and various other domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to income tax and indirect tax matters and are involved in various challenges and litigation in a number of countries, including, in particular, Australia, Brazil, India,\\nKorea, Spain and the United Kingdom, where the amounts under controversy are significant. In some, although not all, cases, we have reserved for potential adjustments to our provision for income taxes and accrual of indirect taxes that may result\\nfrom examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities or final outcomes in judicial proceedings, and we believe that the final outcome of these examinations, agreements or judicial proceedings will not have a material effect\\non our results of operations. If events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in the recognition of benefits in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If\\nour estimates of the federal, state, and foreign income tax liabilities and indirect tax liabilities are less than the ultimate assessment, it could result in a further charge to expense. \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n16.\\nSEGMENT INFORMATION  ASC 280, Segment\\nReporting, establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief\\noperating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our chief operating decision makers (CODMs) are our Chief Executive Officers and Chief Technology Officer. We are organized by\\nline of business and geographically. While our CODMs evaluate results in a number of different ways, the line of business management structure is the primary basis for which the allocation of resources and financial results are assessed. In recent\\nperiods, customer demand has increased at a greater rate for cloud-based IT deployment models relative to on-premise IT deployment models. Our CODMs view the operating results of our three businesses and allocate resources in a manner that is\\nconsistent with the changing market dynamics that we have experienced. As a result, during fiscal 2017, we updated our operating segments. The footnote information below presents the financial information provided to our CODMs for their review and\\nassists our CODMs with evaluating the Company\\x92s performance and allocating Company resources.  We have three businesses\\x97cloud and\\non-premise software, hardware and services\\x97each of which are comprised of a single operating segment.  Our cloud and on-premise software\\nline of business markets, sells and delivers a broad spectrum of applications, platform and infrastructure technologies through our cloud offerings and on-premise software offerings. Our Oracle Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings deliver certain of\\nour applications, platform and infrastructure technologies on a subscription basis via cloud-based deployment models that we host, manage and support. Our IaaS offerings also include Oracle Managed Cloud Services, which are designed to provide\\ncomprehensive software and hardware management, maintenance and security services for on-premise, cloud-based or hybrid IT infrastructures. Our cloud and on-premise software business also licenses our software products, generally on a perpetual\\nbasis, including Oracle Applications, Oracle Database, Oracle Fusion Middleware and Java, among \\n \\xa0 125\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2017  \\xa0\\n \\nothers, for on-premise and other IT environments. Customers that license our software have the option to purchase software license updates and product support contracts, which provide customers\\nwith rights to software product upgrades and maintenance releases, patch releases, internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel during the support period. \\nOur hardware business provides Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, industry-specific hardware, virtualization software, operating systems\\nincluding the Oracle Solaris Operating System and management software to support diverse IT environments.

The complaint alleged that when Oracle announced on March\\xa022 and 23, 2011 that it would no longer develop future versions of its software to run on HP\\x92s\\nItanium-based servers, it breached a settlement agreement signed on September\\xa020, 2010 between HP and Mark Hurd (the Hurd Settlement Agreement), who is our Chief Executive Officer and was both HP\\x92s former chief executive officer and\\nchairman of HP\\x92s board of directors. HP sought a judicial declaration of the parties\\x92 rights and obligations under the Hurd Settlement Agreement and other equitable and monetary relief. \\nOracle answered the complaint and filed a cross-complaint, which was amended on December\\xa02, 2011. The amended cross-complaint alleged claims\\nincluding violation of the Lanham Act. Oracle alleged that HP had secretly agreed to pay Intel to continue to develop and manufacture the Itanium microprocessor, and had misrepresented to customers that the Itanium microprocessor had a long roadmap,\\namong other claims. Oracle sought equitable rescission of the Hurd Settlement Agreement, and other equitable and monetary relief.  The court\\nbifurcated the trial and tried HP\\x92s causes of action for declaratory relief and promissory estoppel without a jury in June 2012. The court issued a final statement of decision on August\\xa028, 2012, finding that the Hurd Settlement Agreement\\nrequired Oracle to continue to develop certain of its software products for use on HP\\x92s Itanium-based servers and to port such products at no cost to HP for as long as HP sells those servers (the Phase One Ruling). A jury trial began on\\nMay\\xa023, 2016. On June\\xa030, 2016, the jury returned a verdict in favor of HP on its claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and \\n\\n \\xa0 128\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2017  \\xa0\\n \\nagainst Oracle on its claim for violation of the Lanham Act (the Phase Two Jury Verdict). The jury awarded HP damages in the amount of $3.0 billion, and HP is entitled to post-judgment interest\\non this award. On August\\xa030, 2016, the court denied HP\\x92s motion for pre-judgment interest. Judgment was entered on October\\xa020, 2016. Oracle posted certain court-mandated surety bonds with the court in order to proceed with its motion\\nfor a new trial and entered into related indemnification agreements with each of the surety bond issuing companies. Oracle filed a motion for a new trial on November\\xa014, 2016, which was denied. \\nOracle filed its notice of appeal on January\\xa017, 2017, specifying that it was appealing the trial court\\x92s Phase One Ruling and Phase Two Jury\\nVerdict. On February\\xa02, 2017, HP filed a notice of appeal of the trial court\\x92s denial of pre-judgment interest. No amounts have been paid or recorded to our results of operations either prior to or subsequent to the Phase One Ruling or\\nPhase Two Jury Verdict. We continue to believe that we have meritorious defenses against HP\\x92s claims, and we intend to present these defenses to the appellate court. Among the arguments we expect to make on appeal are the following: the trial\\ncourt misapplied fundamental principles of contract law and misinterpreted the Hurd Settlement Agreement, including by disregarding the context of the Hurd Settlement Agreement and the evidence of the parties\\x92 mutual intentions; that HP\\x92s\\nbreach of contract claim should fail as a matter of law because HP does not claim and did not prove that Oracle failed to deliver any software under the trial court\\x92s interpretation of the contract; that awarding HP both damages for breach of\\nthe Hurd Settlement Agreement and specific performance of that agreement constitutes an improper double recovery; and that the damages award is excessive, unsupported by the evidence, and contrary to law. We cannot currently estimate a reasonably\\npossible range of loss for this action due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the appeal process and the nature of the claims. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of the appeal process related to this action is\\nuncertain. It is possible that the resolution of this action could have a material impact to our future cash flows and results of operations. \\nDerivative Litigation  On May\\xa03,\\n2017, a stockholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. The derivative suit is brought by an alleged stockholder of Oracle, purportedly on Oracle\\x92s behalf, against Oracle, our Chairman of the Board of\\nDirectors and Chief Technology Officer in his capacities as a director, officer and an alleged controlling stockholder, one of our Chief Executive Officers (who is also a director), three other directors, and Oracle as a nominal defendant. Plaintiff\\nalleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by causing Oracle to agree to purchase NetSuite Inc. (NetSuite) at an excessive price. Plaintiff seeks declaratory relief, an order rescinding or reforming the NetSuite transaction,\\nunspecified monetary damages (including interest), and disgorgement of various unspecified profits, fees, compensation, and benefits. The defendants are scheduled to respond to this complaint by July\\xa019, 2017. While Oracle continues to evaluate\\nthese claims, we do not believe this litigation will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.  Other\\nLitigation  We are party to various other legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, which arise in the ordinary course\\nof business, including proceedings and claims that relate to acquisitions we have completed or to companies we have acquired or are attempting to acquire. While the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that\\nthe outcome of any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will result in losses that are materially in excess of amounts already recognized, if any. \\n \\xa0 129\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n SCHEDULE II \\nORACLE CORPORATION  VALUATION AND QUALIFYING ACCOUNTS  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n (in millions)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nBeginningBalance\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nAdditionsCharged\\xa0\\ntoOperations\\xa0orOther\\xa0Accounts\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nWrite-offs\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nTranslationAdjustments\\nandOther\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nEndingBalance\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Allowances for Doubtful Trade Receivables\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Year Ended:\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n May 31, 2015\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n306\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n56\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n(86\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n9\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n285\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n May 31, 2016\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n285\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n130\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n(90\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n2\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n327\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n May 31, 2017\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n327\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n129\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n(138\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n1\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0319\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n \\xa0 130\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Item 16.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Form 10-K Summary \\nNone. \\n \\xa0 131\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n SIGNATURES \\nPursuant to the requirements of Section\\xa013 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed\\non its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nORACLE CORPORATION\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDate: June 27, 2017\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBy:\\n\\xa0\\n /s/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0SAFRA A.

Our Oracle Cloud offerings provide a comprehensive and fully integrated stack of\\napplication, platform, compute and storage services in all three primary layers of the cloud: Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Our on-premise offerings include Oracle database and\\nmiddleware software, application software, hardware (Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, networking and industry-specific products), and related support and services. We provide our cloud and on-premise offerings to over 400,000 worldwide\\ncustomers via deployment models that best suit their needs.  Our comprehensive and fully integrated stack of SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings\\nintegrate the software, hardware and services on the customers\\x92 behalf in IT environments that we deploy, support and manage for the customer. Our integrated Oracle Cloud offerings are designed to be rapidly deployable to enable customers\\nshorter time to innovation; easily maintainable to reduce integration and testing work; connectable among differing deployment models to enable interchangeability and extendibility between cloud and on-premise IT environments; compatible to easily\\nmove workloads between on-premise IT environments and the Oracle Cloud; cost-effective by requiring lower upfront customer investment; and secure, standards-based and reliable. We are a leader in the core technologies of cloud IT environments,\\nincluding database and middleware software as well as enterprise applications, virtualization, clustering, large-scale systems management and related infrastructure. Our products and services are the building blocks of our Oracle Cloud services, our\\npartners\\x92 cloud services and our customers\\x92 cloud IT environments.  In addition to providing a broad spectrum of cloud offerings, we\\ndevelop and sell our products and services to our customers worldwide for use in their global data centers and on-premise IT environments. An important element of our corporate strategy is to continue our investments in, and innovation with respect\\nto, our products and services that we offer through our cloud and on-premise software, hardware and services businesses. In fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, we invested $5.8 billion, $5.5 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively, in research and\\ndevelopment to enhance our existing portfolio of offerings and products and to develop new technologies and services. We have a deep understanding as to how all components within IT environments\\x97application, platform and\\ninfrastructure\\x97interact and function with one another. We focus our development efforts on improving the performance, security, operation and integration of these differing technologies to make them more cost-effective and easier to deploy,\\nmanage and maintain for our customers and to improve their computing performance relative to our competitors. After the initial purchase of Oracle products and services, our customers can continue to take advantage of our research and development\\ninvestments and deep IT expertise by purchasing and renewing Oracle support offerings, which may include product enhancements that we periodically deliver to our Oracle E-Business Suite, Siebel, PeopleSoft and JD Edwards application software\\nproducts, among others, or by renewing their SaaS, PaaS and IaaS contracts with us.  As customers deploy with the Oracle Cloud, many are\\nadopting a hybrid IT model whereby certain of their IT resources are deployed and managed through the Oracle Cloud, while other of their IT resources are deployed and managed on-premise, and both sets of resources can be managed as one. Our recently\\nintroduced Oracle Cloud at Customer provides an additional deployment model that customers may opt for and utilizes the Oracle Cloud Machine to bring certain Oracle Cloud PaaS and IaaS offerings to a customer\\x92s on-premise IT environment to meet\\ndata sovereignty, data residency, data protection and regulatory business policy requirements, among others. We focus the engineering of our products and services to best connect different deployment models to enable flexibility, ease, agility,\\ncompatibility, extensibility and seamlessness.  A selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate\\nstrategy.

Seasonality and Cyclicality \\nOur quarterly revenues have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including the structure of our sales force incentive compensation\\nplans, which are common in the technology industry. In each fiscal year, our total revenues and operating margins are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fiscal quarter. The operating margins of our businesses (in\\nparticular, our cloud software and on-premise software and hardware segments) are generally affected by seasonal factors in a similar manner as our revenues as certain expenses within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short term. See\\n\\x93Selected Quarterly Financial Data\\x94 in Item 7 of this Annual Report for a more complete description of the seasonality and cyclicality of our revenues, expenses and margins.  Competition  We face intense competition in all aspects of our business. The nature of the\\nIT industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as firms emerge, expand or are acquired, as technology evolves and as customer demands and competitive pressures otherwise change. \\nOur customers are demanding less complexity and lower total cost in the implementation, sourcing, integration and ongoing maintenance of their enterprise\\nsoftware and hardware. Our enterprise cloud and on-premise software and hardware offerings compete directly with some offerings from some of the largest and most competitive companies in the world, including Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft),\\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (IBM), Intel, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, SAP SE and Amazon.com, Inc. and smaller companies like salesforce.com, inc. and Workday, Inc., as well as many others. In addition, due to the low barriers to\\nentry in many of our market segments, new technologies and new and growing competitors frequently emerge to challenge our offerings. Our competitors range from companies offering broad IT solutions across many of our lines of business to vendors\\nproviding point solutions, or offerings focused on a specific functionality, product area or industry. In addition, as we expand into new market segments, we face increased competition as we compete with existing competitors, as well as firms that\\nmay be partners in other areas of our business and other firms with whom we have not previously competed. Moreover, we or our competitors may take certain strategic actions\\x97including acquisitions, partnerships and joint ventures, or\\nrepositioning of product lines\\x97which invite even greater competition in one or more product offering categories.  Key competitive factors\\nin each of the segments in which we currently compete and may compete in the future include: total cost of ownership, performance, scalability, reliability, security, functionality, efficiency, speed to production and quality of technical support.\\nOur product and service sales (and the relative strength of our products and services versus those of our competitors) are also directly and indirectly affected by the following, among other things: \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the adoption of cloud-based IT offerings including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n ease of deployment, use and maintenance of our products and services offerings; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n compatibility between Oracle products and services deployed within on-premise IT environments and public cloud IT environments, including our Oracle\\nCloud environments; \\n \\xa0 18 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the adoption of commodity servers and microprocessors; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the broader \\x93platform\\x94 competition between our industry standard Java technology platform and the .NET programming environment of Microsoft;\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n operating system competition among our Oracle Solaris and Linux operating systems, with alternatives including Microsoft\\x92s Windows Server, and\\nother UNIX and Linux operating systems;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the adoption of open source alternatives to commercial software by enterprise software customers; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n products, features and functionality developed internally by customers and their IT staff; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n products, features or functionality customized and implemented for customers by consultants, systems integrators or other third parties; and\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n attractiveness of offerings from business processing outsourcers.  For more information about the competitive risks we face, refer to Item 1A. \\x93Risk Factors\\x94 included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

Manufacturing\\n To produce our hardware products, we rely on both our internal manufacturing operations as well as third-party manufacturing partners. Our\\ninternal manufacturing operations consist primarily of materials procurement, assembly, testing and quality control of our Oracle Engineered Systems and certain of our enterprise and data center servers, storage products and networking products. For\\nall other manufacturing, we generally rely on third-party manufacturing partners to produce our hardware-related components and hardware products and we may involve our internal manufacturing operations in the final assembly, testing and quality\\ncontrol processes for these components and products. We distribute most of our hardware products either from our facilities or partner facilities. Our manufacturing processes substantially are based on standardization of components across product\\ntypes, centralization of assembly and distribution centers and a \\x93build-to-order\\x94 methodology in which products generally are built only after customers have placed firm orders. Production of our hardware products requires that we purchase\\nmaterials, supplies, product subassemblies and full assemblies from a number of vendors. For most of our hardware products, we have existing alternate sources of supply or such sources are readily available. However, we do rely on sole sources for\\ncertain of our hardware products. As a result, we continue to evaluate potential risks of disruption to our supply chain operations. Refer to \\x93Risk Factors\\x94 included in Item 1A within this Annual Report for additional discussion of the\\nchallenges we encounter with respect to the sources and availability of supplies for our products and the related risks to our business. \\nResearch and Development  We develop the\\nsubstantial majority of our product offerings internally. In addition, we have extended our product offerings and intellectual property through acquisitions of businesses and technologies. We also purchase or license intellectual property rights in\\ncertain circumstances. Internal development allows us to maintain technical control over the design and development of our products. We have a number of United States and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our\\nproducts and technology. While we believe that our patents have value, no single patent is essential to us or to any of our principal business segments. Research and development expenditures were $5.8 billion, $5.5 billion and $5.2 billion in fiscal\\n2016, \\n \\xa0 19 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\n2015 and 2014, respectively, or 16%, 14% and 13% of total revenues in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Rapid technological advances in hardware and software development, evolving\\nstandards in computer hardware and software technology, changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions, offerings and enhancements characterize the cloud and on-premise software and hardware markets in which we compete. We plan to\\ncontinue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development efforts to maintain and improve our current product and services offerings.  Employees  As of May 31, 2016, we employed approximately 136,000 full-time employees,\\nincluding approximately 38,000 in sales and marketing, approximately 6,000 in our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS operations, approximately 10,000 in software license updates and product support, approximately 1,000 in the manufacturing of our hardware\\nproducts, approximately 5,000 in hardware support, approximately 23,000 in services, approximately 40,000 in research and development and approximately 13,000 in general and administrative positions. Of these employees, approximately 51,000 were\\nemployed in the United States and approximately 85,000 were employed internationally. None of our employees in the United States is represented by a labor union; however, in certain foreign subsidiaries labor unions or workers\\x92 councils\\nrepresent some of our employees.

Item 1A.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Risk\\nFactors  We operate in rapidly changing economic and technological environments that present numerous risks, many of which are driven by\\nfactors that we cannot control or predict. The following discussion, as well as our \\x93Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\x94 discussion in Management\\x92s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item\\n7), highlights some of these risks. The risks described below are not exhaustive and you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our securities.  Our Oracle Cloud strategy, including our Oracle Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Data as a Service (DaaS) offerings, may adversely\\naffect our revenues and profitability.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We offer customers a full range of consumption models, including the deployment of our products via our cloud-based SaaS, PaaS, IaaS and DaaS offerings. These business models\\ncontinue to evolve, and we may not be able to compete effectively, generate significant revenues or maintain the profitability of our cloud offerings. Additionally, the increasing prevalence of cloud and SaaS delivery models offered by us and our\\ncompetitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our on-premise enterprise software offerings and our cloud offerings, and has a dampening impact on overall demand for our on-premise software product and service offerings, which has reduced and\\ncould continue to reduce our revenues and profitability, at least in the near term. If we do not successfully execute our cloud computing strategy or anticipate the cloud computing needs of our customers, our reputation as a cloud services provider\\ncould be harmed and our revenues and profitability could decline.  As customer demand for our cloud offerings increases, we experience\\nvolatility in our reported revenues and operating results due to the differences in timing of revenue recognition between our new software licenses and hardware arrangements relative to our cloud offering arrangements. Customers generally purchase\\nour cloud offerings on a subscription basis and revenues from these offerings are generally recognized ratably over the terms of the subscriptions. The deferred revenue that results from sales of our cloud offerings may prevent any deterioration in\\nsales activity associated with our cloud offerings from becoming immediately observable in our consolidated statement of operations. This is in contrast to revenues associated with our new software licenses arrangements whereby new software licenses\\nrevenues are generally recognized in full at the time of delivery of \\n \\xa0 21 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nthe related software licenses. We incur certain expenses associated with the infrastructures and marketing of our cloud offerings in advance of our ability to recognize the revenues associated\\nwith these offerings.  We have also acquired a number of cloud computing companies, and the integration of these companies into our Oracle\\nCloud strategy may not be as efficient or scalable as anticipated, which could adversely affect our ability to fully realize the benefits anticipated from these acquisitions. Our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and services, integrate acquired products and services and enhance our existing products and\\nservices.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Rapid technological advances, changing delivery models and evolving standards in computer hardware and software development and communications infrastructure, changing and increasingly sophisticated customer\\nneeds and frequent new product introductions and enhancements characterize the industries in which we compete. If we are unable to develop new or sufficiently differentiated products and services, enhance and improve our product offerings and\\nsupport services in a timely manner or position and price our products and services to meet demand, customers may not purchase or subscribe to our software, hardware or cloud offerings or renew software support, hardware support or cloud\\nsubscriptions contracts. Renewals of these contracts are important to the growth of our business. In addition, we cannot provide any assurance that the standards on which we choose to develop new products will allow us to compete effectively for\\nbusiness opportunities in emerging areas.  We have continued to refresh and release new offerings of our cloud and on-premise software and\\nhardware products and services, including our Database Multitenant, Database In-Memory, SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, DaaS and Oracle Engineered Systems offerings. Our business may be adversely affected if: \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we do not continue to develop and release these or other new or enhanced products and services within the anticipated time frames;\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n there is a delay in market acceptance of a new, enhanced or acquired product line or service; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n there are changes in information technology (IT) trends that we do not adequately anticipate or address with our product development efforts;\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we do not timely optimize complementary product lines and services; or \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we fail to adequately integrate, support or enhance acquired product lines or services. \\nIf our security measures for our products and services are compromised and as a result, our data, our customers\\x92 data or our IT systems are\\naccessed improperly, made unavailable, or improperly modified, our products and services may be perceived as vulnerable, our brand and reputation could be damaged, the IT services we provide to our customers could be disrupted, and customers may\\nstop using our products and services, all of which could reduce our revenue and earnings, increase our expenses and expose us to legal claims and regulatory actions.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We are in the IT business, and our products and\\nservices, including our Oracle Cloud offerings, store, retrieve, manipulate and manage our customers\\x92 information and data, external data, as well as our own data. We have a reputation for secure and reliable product offerings and related\\nservices and we have invested a great deal of time and resources in protecting the integrity and security of our products, services and the internal and external data that we manage.  At times, we encounter attempts by third parties to identify and exploit product and service vulnerabilities, penetrate or bypass our security measures, and gain unauthorized access to our or our\\ncustomers\\x92, partners\\x92 and suppliers\\x92 software, hardware and cloud offerings, networks and systems, any of which could lead to the compromise of personal information or the confidential information or data of Oracle or our customers.\\nComputer hackers and others may be able to develop and deploy IT related viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that could attack our products and services, exploit potential security vulnerabilities of our products and services,\\ncreate system disruptions and cause shutdowns or denials of service. This is also true for third-party data, products or services incorporated into our own. Data may also be accessed or modified improperly as a result of customer, partner, employee\\nor supplier error or malfeasance and third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce customers, partners, employees or suppliers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our\\ndata, our customers\\x92, suppliers\\x92 or partners\\x92 data or the IT systems of Oracle, its customers, suppliers or partners. \\n \\xa0 22 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n High-profile security breaches at other companies have increased in recent years, and security industry\\nexperts and government officials have warned about the risks of hackers and cyber-attacks targeting IT products and businesses. Although this is an industry-wide problem that affects other software and hardware companies, it affects Oracle in\\nparticular because computer hackers tend to focus their efforts on the most prominent IT companies, and they may focus on Oracle because of our reputation for, and marketing efforts associated with, having secure products and services. These risks\\nwill increase as we continue to grow our cloud offerings and store and process increasingly large amounts of data, including personal information and our customers\\x92 confidential information and data and other external data, and host or manage\\nparts of our customers\\x92 businesses in cloud-based IT environments, especially in customer sectors involving particularly sensitive data such as health sciences, financial services and the government. We also have an active acquisition program\\nand have acquired a number of companies, products, services and technologies over the years. While we make significant efforts to address any IT security issues with respect to our acquired companies, we may still inherit such risks when we\\nintegrate these companies within Oracle.  We could suffer significant damage to our brand and reputation if a cyber-attack or other security\\nincident were to allow unauthorized access to or modification of our customers\\x92 or suppliers\\x92 data, other external data, or our own data or our IT systems or if the services we provide to our customers were disrupted, or if our products or\\nservices are perceived as having security vulnerabilities. Customers could lose confidence in the security and reliability of our products and services, including our cloud offerings, and perceive them to be not secure. This could lead to fewer\\ncustomers using our products and services and result in reduced revenue and earnings. The costs we would incur to address and fix these security incidents would increase our expenses. These types of security incidents could also lead to lawsuits,\\nregulatory investigations and claims and increased legal liability, including in some cases contractual costs related to customer notification and fraud monitoring. Our business practices with respect to the collection, use and management of personal information could give rise to operational interruption, liabilities or reputational harm as a result of\\ngovernmental regulation, legal requirements or industry standards relating to consumer privacy and data protection.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0As regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase and worldwide laws and regulations\\nconcerning the handling of personal information expand and become more complex, potential risks related to data collection and use within our business will intensify. For example, in October 2015, the Court of Justice of the European Union (EU)\\ninvalidated the EU-U.S. Safe Harbor Framework, which Oracle as well as many other global enterprises had relied on in certain contexts to enable the transfer of EU personal data to the United States. While Oracle adapted to this judgment by\\nimplementing other transfer mechanisms permitted under applicable law, the validity of these other mechanisms could also be challenged. If successful, this could require Oracle to make disruptive operational adjustments to the delivery of certain\\nservices that could impact customers and sales in the region. In addition, U.S. and foreign governments have enacted or are considering enacting legislation or regulations, or may in the near future interpret existing legislation or regulations, in\\na manner that could significantly impact the ability of Oracle and our customers and data partners to collect, augment, analyze, use, transfer and share personal and other information that is integral to certain services Oracle provides and data\\nservices. This could be true particularly in those jurisdictions where privacy laws or regulators take a broader view of how personal information is defined, therefore subjecting the handling of such data to heightened restrictions that may be\\nobstructive to the operations of Oracle and its customers and data providers. This impact may be acute in countries that have passed or are considering passing legislation that requires data to remain localized \\x93in country,\\x94 as this\\nimposes financial costs on any service provider that is required to store data in jurisdictions not of its choosing and nonstandard operational processes that are difficult and costly to integrate with global processes. \\nRegulators globally are also imposing greater monetary fines for privacy violations, and the EU is considering legislation that would impose fines for\\nprivacy violations based on a percentage of global revenues. Changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of sensitive data, such as healthcare data or other personal information, could greatly increase our\\ncost of providing our products and services or even prevent us from offering certain of our services in jurisdictions that we operate. Additionally, public perception and standards related to the privacy of personal information can shift rapidly, in\\nways that may affect Oracle\\x92s reputation or influence regulators to enact regulations and laws that may limit Oracle\\x92s ability to provide certain \\n \\xa0 23 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nproducts. Any failure, or perceived failure, by Oracle to comply with U.S. federal, state, or foreign laws and regulations, including laws and regulations regulating privacy, data security, or\\nconsumer protection, or other policies, public perception, standards, self-regulatory requirements or legal obligations, could result in lost or restricted business, proceedings, actions or fines brought against us or levied by governmental entities\\nor others, or could adversely affect our business and harm our reputation.  We might experience significant coding, manufacturing or\\nconfiguration errors in our software, hardware and cloud offerings.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Despite testing prior to the release and throughout the lifecycle of a product or service, our software, hardware and cloud offerings sometimes\\ncontain coding or manufacturing errors that can impact their function, performance and security, and result in other negative consequences. The detection and correction of any errors in released software, hardware or cloud offerings can be time\\nconsuming and costly. Errors in our software, hardware or cloud offerings could affect their ability to properly function or operate with other software, hardware or cloud offerings, could delay the development or release of new products or services\\nor new versions of products or services, could create security vulnerabilities in our products or services, and could adversely affect market acceptance of our products or services. This includes third-party software products or services\\nincorporated into our own. If we experience errors or delays in releasing our software, hardware or cloud offerings or new versions thereof, our sales could be affected and revenues could decline. In addition, we run Oracle\\x92s business\\noperations as well as cloud and other services that we offer to our customers on our products and networks. Therefore, any flaws could affect our ability to conduct our business operations and the operations of our customers. Enterprise customers\\nrely on our software, hardware and cloud offerings and services to run their businesses and errors in our software, hardware or cloud offerings could expose us to product liability, performance and warranty claims as well as significant harm to our\\nbrand and reputation, which could impact our future sales.  We may fail to achieve our financial forecasts due to inaccurate sales\\nforecasts or other factors.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our revenues, particularly our new software licenses revenues and hardware revenues, are difficult to forecast. As a result, our quarterly operating results can fluctuate substantially.\\n We use a \\x93pipeline\\x94 system, a common industry practice, to forecast sales and trends in our business. Our sales personnel monitor\\nthe status of all proposals and estimate when a customer will make a purchase decision and the dollar amount of the sale. These estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline. Our pipeline estimates can prove to be unreliable\\nboth in a particular quarter and over a longer period of time, in part because the \\x93conversion rate\\x94 or \\x93closure rate\\x94 of the pipeline into contracts can be very difficult to estimate. A reduction in the conversion rate, or in\\nthe pipeline itself, could cause us to plan or budget incorrectly and adversely affect our business or results of operations. In particular, a slowdown in IT spending or economic conditions generally can unexpectedly reduce the conversion rate in\\nparticular periods as purchasing decisions are delayed, reduced in amount or cancelled. The conversion rate can also be affected by the tendency of some of our customers to wait until the end of a fiscal period in the hope of obtaining more\\nfavorable terms, which can also impede our ability to negotiate, execute and deliver upon these contracts in a timely manner. In addition, for newly acquired companies, we have limited ability to predict how their pipelines will convert into sales\\nor revenues for a number of quarters following the acquisition. Conversion rates post-acquisition may be quite different from the acquired companies\\x92 historical conversion rates. Differences in conversion rates can also be affected by changes\\nin business practices that we implement in our newly acquired companies. These changes may negatively affect customer behavior.  A substantial\\nportion of our new software licenses and hardware contracts is completed in the latter part of a quarter and a significant percentage of these are larger orders. Because a significant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the short term,\\nsales and revenue shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability. The number of large new software licenses transactions and, to a lesser extent, hardware products transactions increases the risk of fluctuations in\\nour quarterly results because a delay in even a small number of these transactions could cause our quarterly sales, revenues and profitability to fall significantly short of our predictions.  We may experience foreign currency gains and losses. Changes in currency exchange rates can adversely affect customer demand and our revenue and profitability.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We\\nconduct a significant number of transactions and hold cash in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Changes in the values of major foreign currencies, \\n \\xa0 24 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nparticularly the Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound, relative to the U.S. Dollar can significantly affect our total assets, revenues, operating results and cash flows, which are reported in\\nU.S. Dollars. In particular, the economic uncertainties relating to European sovereign and other debt obligations may cause the value of the Euro to fluctuate relative to the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in foreign currency rates, most notably the\\nrecent strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and most other major international currencies, adversely affects our revenue growth in terms of the amounts that we report in U.S. Dollars after converting our foreign currency results into\\nU.S. Dollars and in terms of actual demand for our products and services as these products become relatively more expensive for foreign currency-based enterprises to purchase. In addition, currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of\\nour products in countries outside of the United States. Generally, our revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the dollar weakens. In addition,\\nour reported assets generally are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies as a significant portion of our consolidated cash and bank deposits, among other assets, are held in foreign currencies. The U.S. Dollar\\ngenerally strengthened relative to other currencies, including the Euro, in fiscal 2016, which is reflected in our results. \\nIn addition, we incur foreign currency transaction gains and losses, primarily related to sublicense fees and other intercompany\\nagreements among us and our subsidiaries that we expect to cash settle in the near term, which are charged against earnings in the period incurred. We have a program which primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts designed to offset the\\nrisks associated with certain foreign currency exposures. We may suspend the program from time to time. As a part of this program, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are\\noffset at least in part by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in an effort to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transaction gains or losses. A large portion of our consolidated operations\\nare international, and we expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts. For example, we will experience foreign currency\\ngains and losses in certain instances if it is not possible or cost-effective to hedge our foreign currency exposures, if our hedging efforts are ineffective, or should we suspend our foreign currency forward contract program. Our ultimate realized\\nloss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency exposures that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, whether we have\\nentered into foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors. All of these factors could materially impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.   Certain of our international subsidiaries operate in economies that have been designated as highly inflationary. We have incurred foreign currency losses associated with the devaluation of currencies in\\nthese highly inflationary economies relative to the U.S. Dollar and we may continue to incur such losses in these countries or other emerging market countries where we do business.  Economic, political and market conditions can adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability, which in turn could\\nadversely affect our stock price.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our business is influenced by a range of factors that are beyond our control and that we have no comparative advantage in forecasting. These include: \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n general economic and business conditions;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n overall demand for enterprise software, cloud offerings, hardware and services; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n governmental budgetary constraints or shifts in government spending priorities; and \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n general political developments.  Macroeconomic developments like the continued slow pace of economic recovery in Europe and parts of the United States, Asia and South America could negatively affect our business, operating results,\\nfinancial condition and outlook, which, in turn, could adversely affect our stock price. Any general weakening of, and related declining corporate confidence in, the global economy or the curtailment of government or corporate spending could cause\\ncurrent or potential customers to reduce or eliminate their IT budgets and spending, which could cause customers to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services or cause customers not to pay us or to delay paying us for\\npreviously purchased products and services.\\n \\xa0 25 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n In addition, political unrest in places like Ukraine, Syria and Iraq and the related potential impact on\\nglobal stability, terrorist attacks and the potential for other hostilities in various parts of the world, potential public health crises and natural disasters continue to contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that could\\nadversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability. These factors generally have the strongest effect on our sales of new software licenses, hardware products, hardware support and\\nrelated services and, to a lesser extent, also may affect our renewal rates for software license updates and product support and our subscription-based cloud offerings.  If we are unable to compete effectively, the results of operations and prospects for our business could be harmed.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We face intense competition in all aspects of our\\nbusiness. The nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as firms emerge, expand or are acquired, as technology evolves and as delivery models change. Many vendors develop and market databases, middleware\\nproducts, application development tools, business applications, collaboration products and business intelligence products, among others, that compete with our cloud and on-premise software offerings. These vendors include on-premise software\\ncompanies and companies that offer cloud-based SaaS, PaaS, IaaS and DaaS offerings and business process outsourcing (BPO) as competitive alternatives to buying software and hardware. Our competitors that offer business applications and middleware\\nproducts may influence a customer\\x92s purchasing decision for the underlying database in an effort to persuade potential customers not to acquire our products. We could lose customers if our competitors introduce new competitive products, add new\\nfunctionality, acquire competitive products, reduce prices, better execute on their sales and marketing strategies or form strategic alliances with other companies. We may also face increasing competition from open source software initiatives in\\nwhich competitors may provide software and intellectual property for free. Existing or new competitors could gain sales opportunities or customers at our expense.  Our hardware business competes with, among others, (1) systems manufacturers and resellers of systems based on our own microprocessors and operating systems and those of our competitors, (2)\\nmicroprocessor/chip manufacturers, (3) providers of storage products, (4) certain industry-specific hardware manufacturers including those serving communications, hospitality and retail industries and (5) certain cloud providers that build their own\\nIT infrastructure. Our hardware business causes us to compete with certain companies that historically have been partners. Some of these competitors may have more experience than we do in managing a hardware business. A large portion of our hardware\\nproducts are based on our SPARC microprocessor and Oracle Solaris operating system platform, which has a smaller installed base than certain of our competitors\\x92 platforms and which may make it difficult for us to win new customers that have\\nalready made significant investments in our competitors\\x92 platforms. Certain of these competitors also compete very aggressively on price. A loss in our competitive position could result in lower revenues or profitability, which could adversely\\nimpact our ability to realize the revenue and profitability forecasts for our hardware business.  We may need to change our pricing\\nmodels to compete successfully.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The intense competition we face in the sales of our products and services and general economic and business conditions can put pressure on us to change our prices. If our competitors\\noffer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable, we may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully. Any such changes may reduce margins\\nand could adversely affect operating results. Additionally, the increasing prevalence of cloud and SaaS delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our on-premise enterprise software offerings and our\\ncloud offerings, as well as overall demand for our on-premise software product and service offerings, which could reduce our revenues and profitability. Our software license updates and product support fees and hardware support fees are generally\\npriced as a percentage of our net new software licenses fees and net new hardware products fees, respectively. Our competitors may offer lower pricing on their support offerings, which could put pressure on us to further discount our offerings or\\nsupport pricing.  Any broad-based change to our prices and pricing policies could cause our revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales\\nforce implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies. Some of our competitors may bundle products for promotional purposes or as a long-term pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations. These\\npractices could, over time, significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for certain of our products. If we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of our \\n \\xa0 26 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nproducts or changes in customer demand, our revenues could decrease. The increase in open source software distribution may also cause us to change our pricing models.\\nOur international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating\\nresults.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from, and have significant operations, outside of the United States. Our international operations include software and hardware development, manufacturing,\\nassembly, cloud operations, sales, customer support, consulting and other services and shared administrative service centers.  Compliance with\\ninternational and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations include U.S. laws and local laws which include data privacy\\nrequirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, prohibitions on payments to governmental officials, import and trade restrictions and export requirements. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines,\\ncriminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, could delay\\nor prevent potential acquisitions and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results. Compliance with these laws\\nrequires a significant amount of management attention and effort, which may divert management\\x92s attention from running our business operations and could harm our ability to grow our business, or may increase our expenses as we engage\\nspecialized or other additional resources to assist us with our compliance efforts. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties. We monitor our operations and investigate allegations of\\nimproprieties relating to transactions and the way in which such transactions are recorded. Where circumstances warrant, we provide information and report our findings to government authorities, but no assurance can be given that action will not be\\ntaken by such authorities.  We are also subject to a variety of other risks and challenges in managing an organization operating in various\\ncountries, including those related to:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n general economic conditions in each country or region; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n fluctuations in currency exchange rates and related impacts to customer demand and our operating results; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n difficulties in transferring funds from or converting currencies in certain countries such as Venezuela that have led to a devaluation of our net\\nassets, in particular our cash assets, in that country\\x92s currency;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n regulatory changes, including government austerity measures in certain countries that we may not be able to sufficiently plan for or avoid that may\\nunexpectedly impair bank deposits or other cash assets that we hold in these countries or that impose additional taxes that we may be required to pay in these countries; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n political unrest, terrorism and the potential for other hostilities, including those in Ukraine, Syria, and Iraq; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n common local business behaviors that are in direct conflict with our business ethics, practices and conduct policies; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n natural disasters;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, wildfires and increased storm sensitivity); \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n overlapping tax regimes;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n our ability to repatriate funds held by our foreign subsidiaries to the United States at favorable tax rates; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n public health risks, particularly in areas in which we have significant operations; and \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries. \\n \\xa0 27 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n The variety of risks and challenges listed above could also disrupt or otherwise negatively impact the\\nsupply chain operations for our hardware products segment and the sales of our products and services in affected countries or regions.  As the\\nmajority shareholder of Oracle Financial Services Software Limited (OFSS), a publicly traded company in India, and Oracle Corporation Japan (NOKK), a publicly traded company in Japan, we are faced with several additional risks, including being\\nsubject to local securities regulations and being unable to exert full control that we would otherwise have if OFSS or NOKK were wholly-owned subsidiaries.  Acquisitions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of a transaction.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We continue to invest\\nbillions of dollars to acquire companies, products, services and technologies. We have a selective and active acquisition program and we expect to continue to make acquisitions in the future because acquisitions are an important element of our\\noverall corporate strategy. Risks we may face in connection with our acquisition program include:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n our ongoing business may be disrupted and our management\\x92s attention may be diverted by acquisition, transition or integration activities;\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may have difficulties (1) managing an acquired company\\x92s technologies or lines of business; (2) entering new markets where we have no or\\nlimited direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions; or (3) retaining key personnel from the acquired companies;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n an acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected, we may not integrate an acquired company or technology as successfully as we\\nexpected, we may impose our business practices or alter go-to-market strategies that adversely impact the acquired business or we may overpay for, or otherwise not realize the expected return on, our investments, which could adversely affect our\\nbusiness or operating results and potentially cause impairment to assets that we recorded as a part of an acquisition including intangible assets and goodwill; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n our operating results or financial condition may be adversely impacted by claims or liabilities that we assume from an acquired company or technology\\nor that are otherwise related to an acquisition, including, among others, claims from government agencies, terminated employees, current or former customers, former stockholders or other third parties; pre-existing contractual relationships of an\\nacquired company that we would not have otherwise entered into, the termination or modification of which may be costly or disruptive to our business; unfavorable revenue recognition or other accounting treatment as a result of an acquired\\ncompany\\x92s practices; and intellectual property claims or disputes;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may fail to identify or assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring a company or technology,\\nwhich could result in unexpected litigation or regulatory exposure, unfavorable accounting treatment, unexpected increases in taxes due, a loss of anticipated tax benefits or other adverse effects on our business, operating results or financial\\ncondition;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may not realize the anticipated increase in our revenues from an acquisition for a number of reasons, including if a larger than predicted number of\\ncustomers decline to renew software or hardware support contracts or cloud-based subscription contracts, if we are unable to sell the acquired products or service offerings to our customer base or if contract models of an acquired company do not\\nallow us to recognize revenues on a timely basis;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technologies, products, services and their related supply chain operations with our existing lines of\\nbusiness and supply chain infrastructure and maintaining uniform standards, architecture, controls, procedures and policies;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may have multiple product lines or services offerings as a result of our acquisitions that are offered, priced and supported differently, which\\ncould cause customer confusion and delays;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may have higher than anticipated costs in continuing support and development of acquired products or services, in general and administrative\\nfunctions that support new business models, or in compliance with associated regulations that are more complicated than we had anticipated; \\n \\xa0 28 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may be unable to obtain timely approvals from, or may otherwise have certain limitations, restrictions, penalties or other sanctions imposed on us\\nby, worker councils or similar bodies under applicable employment laws as a result of an acquisition, which could adversely affect our integration plans in certain jurisdictions and potentially increase our integration and restructuring expenses;\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may be unable to obtain required approvals from governmental authorities under competition and antitrust laws on a timely basis, if at all, which\\ncould, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of an acquisition or have other adverse effects on our current business and operations;\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n our use of cash to pay for acquisitions may limit other potential uses of our cash, including stock repurchases, dividend payments and retirement of\\noutstanding indebtedness;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition and we\\nmay have to delay or not proceed with a substantial acquisition if we cannot obtain the necessary funding to complete the acquisition in a timely manner or on favorable terms; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n to the extent that we issue a significant amount of equity securities in connection with future acquisitions, existing stockholders may be diluted and\\nearnings per share may decrease; and  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may experience additional or unexpected changes in how we are required to account for our acquisitions pursuant to U.S. generally accepted\\naccounting principles, including arrangements that we assume from an acquisition.  The occurrence of any of these risks could\\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or several concurrent acquisitions.  Our hardware revenues and profitability could decline if we do not manage the risks associated with our hardware business.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our hardware business may adversely affect\\nour overall profitability if we do not effectively manage the associated risks. We may not achieve our estimated revenue, profit or other financial projections with respect to our hardware business in a timely manner or at all due to a number of\\nfactors, including:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n demand for competing hardware technologies such as cloud infrastructure compute and storage services, which could adversely affect demand for our\\nhardware products offerings;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n our hardware business has higher expenses as a percentage of revenues, and thus has been less profitable, than our cloud and on-premise software\\nbusiness;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n our focus on our more profitable Oracle Engineered Systems, such as our Oracle Exadata Database Machine, Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud, Oracle\\nExalytics In-Memory Machine and Oracle SuperCluster products, which are in the relatively early stages of adoption by our customers, and the de-emphasis of our lower profit margin commodity hardware products, which could adversely affect our\\nhardware revenues because the lower profit products have historically constituted a larger portion of our hardware revenues;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n as we develop and introduce new versions or next generations of our hardware products, customers may defer or delay purchases of existing hardware\\nproducts and wait for these new releases, all of which could adversely affect our hardware revenues in the short term;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n a greater risk of material charges that could adversely affect our operating results, such as potential write-downs and impairments of our inventories;\\nhigher warranty expenses than what we experience in our cloud and on-premise software and services businesses; and amortization and potential impairment of intangible assets associated with our hardware business; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may not be able to increase sales of hardware support contracts or such increase may take longer than we anticipate, which could result in lower\\nrevenues and profitability, or slower than expected growth of such revenues and profitability; and \\n \\xa0 29 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may acquire hardware companies that are strategically important to us but (1) operate in hardware businesses with historically lower operating\\nmargins than our own; (2) have different legacy business practices and go-to-market strategies than our own that we may alter as a part of our integration efforts, which may significantly impact our estimated revenues and profits from the acquired\\ncompany; (3) leverage different platforms or competing technologies that we may encounter difficulties in integrating; or (4) utilize unique manufacturing processes that affect our ability to scale these acquired products within our own\\nmanufacturing operations.  Our hardware offerings are complex products, and if we cannot successfully manage this\\ncomplexity, the results of our hardware business will suffer.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Designing, developing, manufacturing and introducing new hardware products are complicated processes. The development process for our hardware products is\\nuncertain and requires a high level of innovation. After the development phase, we must be able to forecast customer demand and manufacture new hardware products in sufficient volumes to meet this demand and do so in a cost-effective manner. Our\\n\\x93build-to-order\\x94 manufacturing model, in which our hardware products generally are not built until after customers place orders, may from time to time experience delays in delivering our hardware products to customers in a timely manner.\\nThese delays could cause our customers to purchase hardware products and services from our competitors. We must also manage new hardware product introductions and transitions to minimize the impact of customer delayed purchases of existing hardware\\nproducts in anticipation of new hardware product releases. It is also possible that we could experience design or manufacturing flaws, which could delay or prevent the production of the components for which we have previously committed to pay or\\nneed to fulfill orders from customers and could also prevent the production of our hardware products or cause our hardware products to be returned, recalled or rejected resulting in lost revenues, increases in warranty costs or costs related to\\nremediation efforts, damage to our reputation, penalties and litigation.  We depend on suppliers to design, develop, manufacture and deliver on\\na timely basis the necessary technologies and components for our hardware products, and there are some technologies and components that can only be purchased from a single vendor due to price, quality, technology, availability or other business\\nconstraints. As a result, our supply chain operations could be disrupted or negatively impacted by industry consolidation, natural disasters, political unrest, port stoppages or other transportation disruptions or slowdowns or other factors\\naffecting the countries or regions where these single source component vendors are located or where the products are being shipped. We may be unable to purchase these items from the respective single vendors on acceptable terms or may experience\\nsignificant delays or quality issues in the delivery of necessary technologies, parts or components from a particular vendor. If we had to find a new supplier for these technologies, parts and components, hardware product shipments could be delayed,\\nwhich would adversely affect our hardware revenues. We could also experience fluctuations in component prices which, if unanticipated, could negatively impact our hardware business cost structure. Additionally, we could experience changes in\\nshipping and logistics of our hardware products, which could result in fluctuations in prices and negatively impact our hardware margins. These factors may make it difficult for us to plan and procure appropriate component inventory levels in a\\ntimely fashion to meet customer demand for our hardware products. Therefore, we may experience component inventory shortages which may result in production delays or customers choosing to purchase fewer hardware products from us or hardware products\\nfrom our competitors. We negotiate supply commitments with vendors early in the manufacturing process to ensure we have sufficient technologies and components for our hardware products to meet anticipated customer demand. We must also manage our\\nlevels of older component inventories used in our hardware products to minimize inventory write-offs or write-downs. If we have excess inventory, it may be necessary to write-down the inventory, which would adversely affect our operating results. If\\none or more of the risks described above occurs, our hardware business and related operating results could be materially and adversely affected. \\nWe are susceptible to third-party manufacturing and logistics delays, which could result in the loss of sales and\\ncustomers.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We outsource the design, manufacturing, assembly and delivery of certain of our hardware products to a variety of companies, many of which are located outside the United States. Our reliance on these third\\nparties reduces our control over the manufacturing and delivery process, exposing us to risks, including reduced control over quality assurance, product costs, product supply and delivery delays as well as the political and economic uncertainties\\nand natural disasters of the international locations where certain of these third-party \\n \\xa0 30 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nmanufacturers have facilities and operations. Some countries may raise national security concerns or impose market access restrictions based on location of manufacture or sourcing. Any\\nmanufacturing disruption or logistics delays by these third parties could impair our ability to fulfill orders for these hardware products for extended periods of time. If we are unable to manage our relationships with these third parties\\neffectively, or if these third parties experience delays, disruptions, capacity constraints, regulatory issues or quality control problems in their operations, or fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery, our ability to ship and\\ndeliver certain of our hardware products to our customers could be impaired and our hardware business could be harmed.  We have simplified our\\nsupply chain processes by reducing the number of third-party manufacturing partners and the number of locations where these third-party manufacturers build our hardware products. We therefore have become more dependent on a fewer number of these\\nmanufacturing partners and locations. If these partners experience production problems or delays or cannot meet our demand for products, we may not be able to find alternate manufacturing sources in a timely or cost-effective manner, if at all. If\\nwe are required to change third-party manufacturers, our ability to meet our scheduled hardware products deliveries to our customers could be adversely affected, which could cause the loss of sales and existing or potential customers, delayed\\nrevenue recognition or an increase in our hardware products expenses, all of which could adversely affect the margins of our hardware business. \\nThese challenges and risks also exist when we acquire companies with hardware products and related supply chain operations. In some cases, we may be\\ndependent, at least initially, on these acquired companies\\x92 supply chain operations that we are less familiar with and thus we may be slower to adjust or react to these challenges and risks. \\nOur software and hardware indirect sales channel could affect our future operating results.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our software and hardware\\nindirect channel network is comprised primarily of resellers, system integrators/implementers, consultants, education providers, internet service providers, network integrators and independent software vendors. Our relationships with these channel\\nparticipants are important elements of our software and hardware marketing and sales efforts. Our financial results could be adversely affected if our contracts with channel participants were terminated, if our relationships with channel\\nparticipants were to deteriorate, if any of our competitors enter into strategic relationships with or acquire a significant channel participant, if the financial condition or operations of our channel participants were to weaken or if the level of\\ndemand for our channel participants\\x92 products and services were to decrease. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining, expanding or developing our relationships with channel participants. If we are not successful, we\\nmay lose sales opportunities, customers and revenues.  We may not be able to protect our intellectual property\\nrights.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We rely on copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts, these\\nprotections may be limited. Unauthorized third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer portions of our products or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property. Any patents owned by us may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. Any of\\nour pending or future patent applications, whether or not being currently challenged, may not be issued with the scope of the claims we seek, if at all. In addition, the laws of some countries do not provide the same level of protection of our\\nintellectual property rights as do the laws and courts of the United States. If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use, or other misappropriation, we may not remain competitive. \\nThird parties have claimed and, in the future, may claim infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights and/or breach of license agreement\\nprovisions.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We periodically receive notices from, or have lawsuits filed against us by, others claiming infringement or other misuse of their intellectual property rights and/or breach of our agreements with them.\\nThese third parties include entities that do not have the capabilities to design, manufacture, or distribute products or services or that acquire intellectual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual\\nproperty through asserting claims of infringement and misuse. We expect to continue to receive such claims as:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we continue to acquire companies and expand into new businesses; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows; \\n \\xa0 31 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the use and support of third-party code (including open source code) becomes more prevalent in the industry; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the volume of issued patents continues to increase; and \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the proliferation of non-practicing entities asserting intellectual property infringement claims increases. \\nResponding to any such claim, regardless of its validity, could:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n be time consuming, costly and result in litigation;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n divert management\\x92s time and attention from developing our business; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable;\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n require us to stop selling or to redesign certain of our products; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n require us to release source code to third parties, possibly under open source license terms; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n require us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers; or \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. \\nOur periodic workforce restructurings, including reorganizations of our sales force, can be disruptive.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We have in\\nthe past restructured or made other adjustments to our workforce, including our direct sales force on which we rely heavily, in response to management changes, product changes, performance issues, change in strategies, acquisitions and other\\ninternal and external considerations. In the past, these types of sales force restructurings have resulted in increased restructuring costs, increased sales and marketing costs and temporary reduced productivity while the sales teams adjusted to\\ntheir new roles and responsibilities. In addition, we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth or cost savings benefits of these restructurings, or do so within the expected timeframe. These effects could recur in connection with future\\nacquisitions and other restructurings and our revenues and other results of operations could be negatively affected.  We may lose key\\nemployees or may be unable to hire enough qualified employees.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We rely on hiring qualified employees and the continued service of our senior management, including our Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief\\nTechnology Officer and founder, our Chief Executive Officers, other members of our executive team and other key employees. In the technology industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business, product development,\\ntechnical and other personnel. We may also experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher sales. We may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing\\npersonnel. With rare exceptions, we do not have long-term employment or non-competition agreements with our employees. Members of our senior management team have left Oracle over the years for a variety of reasons, and we cannot assure you that\\nthere will not be additional departures, which may be disruptive to our operations.  We continually focus on improving our cost structure by\\nhiring personnel in countries where advanced technical expertise and other expertise are available at lower costs. When we make adjustments to our workforce, we may incur expenses associated with workforce reductions that delay the benefit of a more\\nefficient workforce structure. We may also experience increased competition for employees in these countries as the trend toward globalization continues, which may affect our employee retention efforts and increase our expenses in an effort to offer\\na competitive compensation program.  Our general compensation program includes restricted stock units, performance stock units and stock\\noptions, which are important tools in attracting and retaining employees in our industry. If our stock price performs poorly, it may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract employees. We continually evaluate our compensation practices and\\nconsider changes from time to time, such as reducing the number of employees granted equity awards or the number of equity awards granted per employee and granting alternative forms of stock-based compensation, which may have an impact on our\\nability to retain employees and the amount of stock-based compensation expense that we record. Any changes in our compensation practices or those of our competitors could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new\\npersonnel. \\n \\xa0 32 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Our sales to government clients expose us to business volatility and risks, including government\\nbudgeting cycles and appropriations, early termination, audits, investigations, sanctions and penalties.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We derive revenues from contracts with the U.S. government, state and local governments, and foreign governments\\nand their respective agencies, which may terminate most of these contracts at any time, without cause. There is increased pressure on governments and their agencies, both domestically and internationally, to reduce spending. Further, our U.S.\\nfederal government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations made by the U.S. Congress to fund the expenditures under these contracts. Similarly, our contracts with U.S. state and local governments, foreign governments and their\\nagencies are generally subject to government funding authorizations. Additionally, government contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations which could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions,\\nincluding termination of contracts, refund of a portion of fees received, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business.  We may not receive significant revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years, if at all.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Developing software, cloud and hardware\\nofferings is expensive and the investment in the development of these offerings often involves a long return on investment cycle. An important element of our corporate strategy is to continue to make significant investments in research and\\ndevelopment and related product and service opportunities both through internal investments and the acquisition of intellectual property from companies that we have acquired. Accelerated product and service introductions and short software and\\nhardware life cycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by revenue increases. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of\\nresources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. However, we do not expect to receive significant revenues from these investments for several years, if at all. \\nBusiness disruptions could adversely affect our operating results.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0A significant portion of our critical business\\noperations are concentrated in a few geographic areas. We are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems could cause delays in completing sales and providing services, including some of our cloud offerings. A major\\nearthquake, fire or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating\\nresults could be materially and adversely affected.  Adverse litigation results could affect our\\nbusiness.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We are subject to various legal proceedings. Litigation can be lengthy, expensive and disruptive to our operations, and can divert our management\\x92s attention away from running our core business. The\\nresults of our litigation also cannot be predicted with certainty. An adverse decision could result in monetary damages or injunctive relief that could affect our business, operating results or financial condition. Additional information regarding\\ncertain of the lawsuits we are involved in is discussed under Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.  We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in both the\\nUnited States and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities and those authorities often do not\\nagree with positions taken by us on our tax returns.  Changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significantly adverse impact on our\\neffective tax rate. For example, the United States, many countries in the EU, and other countries where we do business, are actively considering or have enacted changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations,\\nincluding changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, which could have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. Further, in the ordinary course of a global business, there are many intercompany transactions and\\ncalculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our intercompany transfer pricing has been and is currently being reviewed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and by foreign tax jurisdictions and will likely be subject to\\nadditional audits in the future. Although we have negotiated certain unilateral Advance Pricing Agreements with the IRS and certain selected bilateral Advance Pricing Agreements that cover some of our intercompany transfer pricing issues and\\npreclude the relevant tax authorities from making a transfer pricing adjustment within the scope of these agreements, these agreements do not cover \\n \\xa0 33 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nsubstantial elements of our transfer pricing. In recent periods, transfer pricing audits in many foreign jurisdictions have become increasingly contentious. Similarly, certain jurisdictions are\\nincreasingly raising concerns about certain withholding tax matters. In addition, our provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions which we consider to be indefinitely reinvested\\noutside the United States that have lower statutory tax rates and earnings being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates.  We are also subject to non-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. We\\nare regularly under audit by tax authorities with respect to these non-income based taxes and may have exposure to additional non-income based tax liabilities. Our acquisition activities have increased our non-income based tax exposures,\\nparticularly with our entry into the hardware business, which increased the volume and complexity of laws and regulations that we are subject to and with which we must comply. Although we believe that our income and non-income based tax estimates are reasonable, there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is\\nreflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals.  Charges to earnings resulting from acquisitions may adversely affect our\\noperating results.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Under business combination accounting standards pursuant to ASC 805, Business Combinations, we recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling\\ninterests in acquired companies generally at their acquisition date fair values and, in each case, separately from goodwill. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess amount of consideration transferred, which is also generally\\nmeasured at fair value, and the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain.\\nAfter we complete an acquisition, the following factors could result in material charges and adversely affect our operating results and may adversely affect our cash flows: \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n costs incurred to combine the operations of companies we acquire, such as transitional employee expenses and employee retention, redeployment or\\nrelocation expenses;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n impairment of goodwill, in particular within our consulting reporting unit, or impairment of intangible assets, both asset types of which have\\nincreased in recent years due to our acquisitions and may continue to increase in the future;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n amortization of intangible assets acquired;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n a reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets acquired; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n identification of, or changes to, assumed contingent liabilities, both income tax and non-income tax related, after our final determination of the\\namounts for these contingencies or the conclusion of the measurement period (generally up to one year from the acquisition date), whichever comes first; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n charges to our operating results to maintain certain duplicative pre-merger activities for an extended period of time or to maintain these activities\\nfor a period of time that is longer than we had anticipated, charges to eliminate certain duplicative pre-merger activities, and charges to restructure our operations or to reduce our cost structure; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n charges to our operating results due to expenses incurred to effect the acquisition; and \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n charges to our operating results due to the expensing of certain stock awards assumed in an acquisition. \\nSubstantially all of these costs will be accounted for as expenses that will decrease our net income and earnings per share for the periods in which those\\ncosts are incurred. For example, we recognized a goodwill impairment loss in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 relating to our hardware reporting unit. Charges to our operating results in any given period could differ substantially from other\\nperiods based on the timing and size of our future acquisitions and the extent of integration activities. A more detailed discussion of our accounting for business combinations and other items is presented in the \\x93Critical Accounting Policies\\nand Estimates\\x94 section of Management\\x92s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 7). \\n \\xa0 34 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n There are risks associated with our outstanding and future\\nindebtedness.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0As of May 31, 2016, we had an aggregate of $43.9 billion of outstanding indebtedness that will mature between calendar year 2016 and calendar year 2055 and we may incur additional indebtedness in the\\nfuture. Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations, generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt and the other factors discussed in this section.\\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.  We may also need to refinance a portion of our\\noutstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other\\nfactors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. Should we incur future increases in interest expense, our ability to utilize\\ncertain of our foreign tax credits to reduce our U.S. federal income tax could be limited, which could unfavorably affect our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. In addition, changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit\\nrating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase the interest amounts we pay on certain outstanding or future debt. These risks could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\\n Environmental and other related laws and regulations subject us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and\\ncosts.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Some of our cloud and hardware operations are subject to state, federal and international laws governing protection of the environment, proper handling and disposal of materials used for these products, human\\nhealth and safety, the use of certain chemical substances and the labor practices of suppliers. We endeavor to comply with these environmental and other laws, yet compliance with these environmental and other laws could increase our product design,\\ndevelopment, procurement, manufacturing, delivery, cloud operations and administration costs, limit our ability to manage excess and obsolete non-compliant inventory, change our sales activities, or otherwise impact future financial results of our\\ncloud and hardware businesses. Any violation of these laws can subject us to significant liability, including fines, penalties and possible prohibition of sales of our products and services into one or more states or countries and result in a\\nmaterial adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our cloud and hardware businesses.  The U.S. Securities and\\nExchange Commission has adopted disclosure requirements for companies that use certain \\x93conflict minerals\\x94 (commonly referred to as tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold) in their products. Our supply chain is multi-tiered, global and highly\\ncomplex. As a provider of hardware end products, we are several steps removed from the mining and smelting or refining of any conflict minerals in our supply chain. Accordingly, our ability to determine with certainty the origin and chain of custody\\nof conflict minerals is limited. Our relationships with customers and suppliers could suffer if we are unable to describe our products as \\x93conflict-free.\\x94 We may also face increased costs in complying with conflict minerals disclosure\\nrequirements.  A significant portion of our hardware revenues come from international sales. Environmental legislation, such as the EU\\nDirective on Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS), the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive) and China\\x92s regulation on Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information\\nProducts, may increase our cost of doing business internationally and impact our hardware revenues from the EU, China and other countries with similar environmental legislation as we endeavor to comply with and implement these requirements. The\\ncumulative impact of international environmental legislation could be significant.  Our stock price could become more volatile and your\\ninvestment could lose value.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0All of the factors discussed in this section could affect our stock price. The timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products, product enhancements or technological\\nadvances by our competitors or us and any announcements by us of acquisitions, major transactions, or management changes could also affect our stock price. Changes in the amounts and frequency of share repurchases or dividends could adversely affect\\nour stock price. Our stock price is subject to speculation in the press and the analyst community, changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts, changes in investors\\x92 or analysts\\x92 valuation measures for our stock,\\nour credit ratings and market trends unrelated to our performance. A significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class actions lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and divert management\\x92s\\nattention and resources, which could adversely affect our business. \\n \\xa0 35 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Item 1B.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Unresolved Staff Comments \\nNone.

In June 2016, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share of our outstanding\\ncommon stock payable on July 27, 2016 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 6, 2016. We currently expect to continue paying comparable cash dividends on a quarterly basis; however, future declarations of dividends and the\\nestablishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.  For equity compensation\\nplan information, please refer to Item 12 in Part III of this Annual Report.  Stock Repurchase Programs \\nOur Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On March 15, 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors\\napproved an expansion of our stock repurchase program by an additional $10.0 billion. As of May 31, 2016, approximately $8.8 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. \\nOur stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working\\ncapital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time\\nthrough open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.  The following table summarizes the stock repurchase activity for the three months ended May 31, 2016 and the approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased pursuant to our stock repurchase\\nprogram:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n (in millions, except per share amounts)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nTotal\\xa0Number\\xa0ofSharesPurchased\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nAverage\\xa0PricePaid perShare\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nTotal\\xa0Number\\xa0ofShares\\xa0Purchased\\xa0asPart of\\nPubliclyAnnouncedProgram\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nApproximate\\xa0DollarValue\\xa0of\\xa0Shares\\xa0thatMay\\xa0Yet\\xa0BePurchasedUnder the Program\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n March 1, 2016\\x97March 31, 2016\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n16.9\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n39.50\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n16.9\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n10,142.4\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n April 1, 2016\\x97April 30, 2016\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n15.8\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n40.80\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n15.8\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n9,496.6\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n May 1, 2016\\x97May 31, 2016\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n16.5\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n39.69\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n16.5\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n8,840.6\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Total\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n49.2\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n39.98\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n49.2\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xa0 37 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Stock Performance Graph and Cumulative Total Return \\nThe graph below compares the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock with the cumulative total return of the S&P 500 Index and the\\nS&P Information Technology Index for each of the last five fiscal years ended May 31, 2016, assuming an investment of $100 at the beginning of such period and the reinvestment of any dividends.

Our total\\nassets were also favorably impacted by the issuance of $3.8 billion of short term borrowings in fiscal 2016. These increases were partially offset by cash used for acquisitions, repurchases of our common stock, dividend payments and capital\\nexpenditures made in all periods presented and the repayments of certain of our senior notes in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2013.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n(3)\\xa0\\n Our notes payable and other borrowings, which represented the summation of our notes payable, current and other current borrowings, and notes payable\\nand other non-current borrowings as reported per our consolidated balance sheets as of the dates listed in the table above, increased between fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2016 due to the issuances of $3.8 billion of short-term borrowings made pursuant to\\nour revolving credit agreements in fiscal 2016, and the issuances of long-term senior notes of $20.0 billion in fiscal 2015, \\x802.0 billion and $3.0 billion in fiscal 2014, and $5.0 billion in fiscal 2013.

We have a deep understanding as to how all components within IT environments\\x97application, platform and infrastructure\\x97interact and function with one another. We\\nfocus our development efforts on improving the performance, security, operation and integration of these differing technologies to make them more cost-effective and easier to deploy, manage and maintain for our customers and to improve their\\ncomputing performance relative to our competitors. After the initial purchase of Oracle products and services, our customers can continue to take advantage of our research and development investments and deep IT expertise by purchasing and renewing\\nOracle support offerings, which may include product enhancements that we periodically deliver to our Oracle E-Business Suite, Siebel, PeopleSoft and JD Edwards application software products, among others, or by renewing their SaaS, PaaS and IaaS\\ncontracts with us.  As customers deploy with the Oracle Cloud, many are adopting a hybrid IT model whereby certain of their IT resources are\\ndeployed and managed through the Oracle Cloud, while other of their IT resources are deployed and managed on-premise, and both sets of resources can be managed as one. We focus the engineering of our products and services to best connect these\\ndifferent deployment models to enable flexibility, ease, agility, compatibility, extensibility and seamlessness.  A selective and active\\nacquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. We believe our acquisitions enhance the products and services that we can offer to customers, expand our customer base, provide greater scale to accelerate innovation, grow\\nour revenues and earnings, and increase stockholder value. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of companies, products, services and \\n \\xa0 40 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\ntechnologies that add to, are complementary to, or have otherwise enhanced our existing offerings. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies to further our\\ncorporate strategy.  We have three businesses that deliver our application, platform and infrastructure technologies: cloud and on-premise\\nsoftware, hardware and services. These businesses can be further divided into certain operating segments (Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, provides additional information related to our\\noperating segments). Each of our businesses and operating segments has unique characteristics and faces different opportunities and challenges. Although we report our actual results in U.S. Dollars, we conduct a significant number of transactions in\\ncurrencies other than U.S. Dollars. Therefore, we present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations. An overview of our\\nthree businesses and related operating segments follows.  Cloud and On-Premise Software Business \\nOur cloud and on-premise software business, which represented 78%, 77% and 76% of our total revenues in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, is\\ncomprised of three operating segments: (1) cloud software and on-premise software, (2) cloud IaaS and (3) software license updates and product support. On a constant currency basis, we expect that our cloud and on-premise software business\\x92\\ntotal revenues generally will continue to increase due to continued demand for our software products, expected growth in our cloud and software license updates and product support offerings, including the high percentage of customers that renew\\ntheir software license updates and product support contracts, and contributions from our acquisitions, which should allow us to grow and continue to make investments in research and development. \\nCloud Software and On-Premise Software:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our cloud software and on-premise software line of business markets, sells\\nand delivers a broad spectrum of application and platform technologies through our SaaS and PaaS offerings, which are certain of our software applications and platforms that are delivered via a cloud-based IT environment that we host, manage and\\nsupport, and through the licensing of our software products including Oracle Applications, Oracle Database, Oracle Fusion Middleware and Java, among others.  We believe the comprehensiveness and breadth of our SaaS, PaaS and on-premise software offerings provides greater benefit to our customers and differentiates us from many of our competitors that offer\\nmore limited or specialized software offerings. Our SaaS and PaaS offerings are designed to be interoperable with one another, thereby limiting the integration and tuning of multiple cloud applications from multiple vendors. Our SaaS and PaaS\\nofferings are designed to deliver secure data isolation and flexible upgrades, self-service access controls for users, a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) for integration with on-premise systems, and a high performance, high availability\\ninfrastructure based on our infrastructure technologies including Oracle Engineered Systems. Our on-premise software offerings are substantially designed to operate on both single server and clustered server configurations for cloud or on-premise IT\\nenvironments, and to support a choice of operating systems including Oracle Solaris, Oracle Linux, Microsoft Windows and third-party UNIX products, among others. Our commitment to industry standards results in software offerings that work in\\ncustomer environments with Oracle or non-Oracle hardware or software components and that can be adapted to meet specific industry or business needs. We focus the engineering of our products and services to best connect cloud and on-premise\\ndeployment models to enable flexibility, ease, agility, compatibility, extensibility and seamlessness. All of these approaches are designed to support customer choice and reduce customer risk. Our customers include businesses of many sizes,\\ngovernment agencies, educational institutions and resellers. We market and sell our software offerings to these customers with a sales force positioned to offer the combinations that best fit customer needs. We enable customers to evolve and\\ntransform to substantially any IT environment at whatever pace is most appropriate for them.  Our SaaS and PaaS revenues and new software\\nlicenses revenues are affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, the strategy for and competitive position of our software offerings, our acquisitions, our ability to deliver and renew\\nour SaaS and PaaS contracts with our existing customers and foreign currency rate fluctuations. In recent periods, we have placed significant strategic emphasis on growing our cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues, which has affected the growth of our cloud\\nSaaS and \\n \\xa0 41 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nPaaS revenues and our new software licenses revenues and the related expenses. We expect these trends will continue. Our SaaS and PaaS arrangements are generally one to three years in duration\\nand we strive to renew these contracts when they are eligible for renewal. The substantial majority of our new software license transactions are characterized by long sales cycles and the timing of a few large software license transactions can\\nsubstantially affect our quarterly new software licenses revenues.  Cloud software and on-premise software revenues represented 25%, 26% and\\n28% of our total revenues in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our cloud software and on-premise software segment\\x92s margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the\\nhistorical upward trend of our new software licenses revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this segment are predominantly fixed in the short term. As discussed further below under \\x93Supplemental\\nDisclosure Related to Certain Charges,\\x94 our cloud software and on-premise software segment\\x92s margin has been and will continue to be affected by the fair value adjustments relating to the cloud SaaS and PaaS obligations that we assumed in\\nour business combinations and by the amortization of intangible assets associated with companies and technologies that we have acquired. \\nCloud Infrastructure as a Service:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our cloud IaaS segment, which represented 2% of our total revenues in each of\\nfiscal 2016 and 2015, and 1% of our total revenues in fiscal 2014, provides infrastructure cloud services that are enterprise-grade, hosted and supported within the Oracle Cloud to perform elastic compute, storage and networking services on a\\nsubscription basis. Our cloud IaaS segment also offers Oracle Managed Cloud Services, which are comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services for customer IT infrastructure for a fee for a stated term that are hosted at our\\nOracle data center facilities, select partner data centers or physically on-premise at customer facilities.  Software License Updates and\\nProduct Support:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Software license updates and product support revenues are generated through the sale of software support contracts relating to on-premise new software licenses purchased by our customers. Customers\\nthat purchase software license updates and product support are granted rights to unspecified product upgrades and maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period, as well as technical support assistance. Our software\\nlicense updates and product support contracts are generally one year in duration. Substantially all of our on-premise software license customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually. The growth of software\\nlicense updates and product support revenues is primarily influenced by three factors: (1) the percentage of our software support contract customer base that renews its software support contracts, (2) the amount of new software support contracts\\nsold in connection with the sale of new software licenses and (3) the amount of software support contracts assumed from companies we have acquired.  Software license updates and product support revenues, which represented 51%, 49% and 47% of our total revenues in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, is our highest margin business unit. Our\\nsoftware support margins during fiscal 2016 were 91% and accounted for 86% of our total margins over the same period. Our software license updates and product support margins have been affected by fair value adjustments relating to software support\\nobligations assumed in business combinations and by the amortization of intangible assets, both of which are discussed further below under \\x93Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges.\\x94 Over the longer term, we believe that software\\nlicense updates and product support revenues and margins will grow for the following reasons:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n substantially all of our on-premise new software license customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software support contracts\\nwhen eligible for renewal;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n substantially all of our customers purchase software license updates and product support contracts when they buy new software licenses, resulting in a\\nfurther increase in our software support contract base. Even if new software licenses revenues growth was flat, software license updates and product support revenues would continue to grow in comparison to the corresponding prior year periods\\nassuming contract renewal and cancellation rates and foreign currency rates remained relatively constant, since substantially all new software licenses transactions result in the sale of software license updates and product support contracts, which\\nadd to our software support contract base; and \\n \\xa0 42 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n our acquisitions have increased our software support contract base, as well as the portfolio of products available to be licensed and supported.\\n Hardware Business  Our hardware business is comprised of two operating segments: (1) hardware products and (2) hardware support. Our hardware business represented 13% of our total revenues in fiscal 2016, and 14% of our\\ntotal revenues in each of fiscal 2015 and 2014. We expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our cloud and on-premise software business due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and\\ndistribute these products and to provide support services, including direct materials and labor costs. We expect to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and services and to develop new hardware products\\nand services.  Hardware Products:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We provide a broad selection of hardware and related services, including\\nOracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, networking, workstations and related devices, industry-specific hardware, virtualization software, operating systems, and management software to support diverse IT environments, including cloud computing\\nenvironments. We engineer our hardware products with virtualization and management capabilities to enable the rapid deployment and efficient management of cloud and on-premise IT infrastructures. Our hardware products support many of the\\nworld\\x92s largest cloud infrastructures, including the Oracle Cloud.  Our hardware products are designed to be easier to deploy, manage and\\nmaintain for our customers and to improve computing performance relative to our competitors\\x92 offerings. We design our hardware products to seamlessly connect cloud and on-premise IT environments to further enable interoperability,\\ninterchangeability and extendibility and to work in customer environments that may include other Oracle or non-Oracle hardware or software components. Our flexible and open approach provides Oracle customers with a broad range of choices in how they\\ndeploy our hardware products, which we believe is a priority for our customers.  Oracle Engineered Systems are core to our hardware offerings\\nand are important elements of our data center and cloud computing offerings including the Oracle Cloud. These pre-integrated products are designed to integrate multiple Oracle technology components to work together to deliver improved performance,\\navailability, security and operational efficiency relative to our competitors\\x92 products; to be upgraded effectively and efficiently; and to simplify maintenance cycles by providing a single solution for software patching. Oracle Engineered\\nSystems are tested before they are shipped to customers and delivered ready-to-run, enabling customers to shorten deployment time to production. We offer certain of our Oracle Engineered Systems technologies through flexible deployment options\\nincluding as a cloud service and for on-premise IT environments.  We offer a wide range of server products using our SPARC microprocessor. Our\\nSPARC servers run the Oracle Solaris operating system and are designed to be differentiated by their reliability, security, and scalability. Our mid-size and large servers are designed to offer better performance and lower total cost of ownership\\nthan competitive UNIX systems for business critical applications, for customers having more computationally intensive needs, and as platforms for building cloud computing IT environments. Our SPARC servers are also a core component of the Oracle\\nSuperCluster, one of our Oracle Engineered Systems.  We also offer enterprise x86 servers. These x86 servers are based on microprocessors from\\nIntel Corporation and are compatible with Oracle Solaris, Oracle Linux, Microsoft Windows and other operating systems. Our x86 servers are also a core component of many of our Oracle Engineered Systems including the Oracle Exadata Database Machine,\\nOracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud, Oracle Exalytics In-Memory Machine and the Oracle Big Data Appliance.  Our storage products are engineered for\\nthe cloud and designed to securely store, manage, protect, archive, backup and recover customers\\x92 mission critical data assets. Our storage products consist of disk, flash, tape, virtual tape and hardware-related software including file systems\\nsoftware, back-up and archive software, hierarchical storage management software and networking for mainframe and heterogeneous systems environments. We also offer certain of our storage offerings as a cloud service. \\n \\xa0 43 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Our networking and data center fabric products, including Oracle Virtual Networking, and Oracle InfiniBand\\nand Ethernet technologies, are used with our server and storage products and are integrated into our management tools to help enterprise customers improve infrastructure performance, reduce cost and complexity and simplify storage and server\\nconnectivity.  We offer hardware products and services designed for certain specific industries. Our point-of-sale hardware offerings include\\npoint-of-sale terminals and related hardware that are designed for managing businesses within the food and beverage, hotel and retail industries, among others. Our hardware products and services for communications networks include network signaling,\\npolicy control and subscriber data management solutions, and session border control technology, among others.  The majority of our hardware\\nproducts are sold through indirect channels, including independent distributors and value-added resellers.  To produce our hardware products,\\nwe rely on both our internal manufacturing operations as well as third-party manufacturing partners. Our internal manufacturing operations consist primarily of materials procurement, assembly, testing and quality control of our Oracle Engineered\\nSystems and certain of our enterprise and data center servers and storage products. For all other manufacturing, we generally rely on third-party manufacturing partners to produce our hardware-related components and hardware products and we may\\ninvolve our internal manufacturing operations in the final assembly, testing and quality control processes for these components and products. We distribute most of our hardware products either from our facilities or partner facilities. We strive to\\nreduce costs by simplifying our manufacturing processes through increased standardization of components across product types and a \\x93build-to-order\\x94 manufacturing process in which products generally are built only after customers have\\nplaced firm orders.  Our hardware products revenues, cost of hardware products and hardware operating margins that we report are affected by\\nour strategy for and the competitive position of our hardware products, the strength of general economic and business conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, certain of our acquisitions and foreign currency rate fluctuations. In addition,\\nour operating margins for our hardware products segment have been and will be affected by the amortization of intangible assets.  Our quarterly\\nhardware products revenues are difficult to predict. The timing of customer orders and delays in our ability to timely manufacture or deliver a few large hardware transactions, among other factors, could substantially affect the amount of hardware\\nproducts revenues, expenses and operating margins that we report.  Hardware Support:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our hardware support\\nofferings provide customers with software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products, such as Oracle Solaris and certain other software products, and can include product repairs, maintenance\\nservices and technical support services. Typically, our hardware support contract arrangements are priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees, are invoiced to the customer at the beginning of the support period and are one year in\\nduration. We continue to evolve hardware support processes that are intended to proactively identify and solve quality issues and to increase the amount of new and renewed hardware support contracts sold in connection with the sales of our hardware\\nproducts. Our hardware support revenues that we report are influenced by a number of factors, including the volume of purchases of hardware products, the pricing and mix of hardware products purchased, whether customers decide to purchase hardware\\nsupport contracts at or in close proximity to the time of hardware product sale, the percentage of our hardware support contract customer base that renews its support contracts and our acquisitions. Substantially all of these factors are heavily\\ninfluenced by our customers\\x92 decisions to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available.  Our hardware support margins have been and will be affected by certain of our acquisitions and related accounting, including fair value adjustments relating to hardware support obligations assumed and by\\nthe amortization of intangible assets, both of which are discussed further below under \\x93Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges.\\x94 \\n \\xa0 44 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Services Business  Our services business, which represented 9% of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 10% of our total revenues in fiscal 2014, is comprised of the remainder of our\\noperating segments. Our services business has lower margins than our cloud and on-premise software and hardware businesses. Our services revenues are impacted by our strategy for and the competitive position of our services, certain of our\\nacquisitions, general economic conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, personnel reductions in our customers\\x92 IT departments, tighter controls over discretionary spending, our strategic emphasis on growing our cloud revenues and the\\ngrowth in our software and hardware offerings. Our services business\\x92 offerings include:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n consulting services that are designed to help our customers and global system integrator partners more successfully architect and deploy our offerings,\\nincluding IT strategy alignment, enterprise architecture planning and design, initial software implementation and integration, and ongoing software enhancements and upgrades. We utilize a global, blended delivery model to optimize value for our\\ncustomers and partners, consisting of on-premise consultants from local geographies, industry specialists and consultants from our global delivery and solution centers; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n advanced customer support services, which are provided on-premise and remotely to our customers to enable increased performance and higher availability\\nof their Oracle products and services and also include certain other services; and  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n education services for Oracle products and services, including training and certification programs that are offered to customers, partners and\\nemployees through a variety of formats, including instructor-led classes at our education centers, live virtual training, self-paced online training, private events and custom training. \\nAcquisitions  A selective\\nand active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies, products, services and technologies, including MICROS\\nSystems, Inc. (MICROS) in fiscal 2015.  We believe our acquisition program strengthens our competitive position, enhances the products and\\nservices that we can offer to customers, expands our customer base, provides greater scale to accelerate innovation, grows our revenues and earnings and increases stockholder value. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and\\ntechnologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy. Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provides additional information related to our recent acquisitions. \\nWe believe that we can fund our future acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from\\noperations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flow and return on invested capital targets before\\ndeciding to move forward with an acquisition.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates \\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the Financial\\nAccounting Standards Board\\x92s (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), and we consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. GAAP, as set forth within\\nthe ASC, requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments\\nand assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods\\npresented. To the extent that there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The accounting policies that reflect our\\n\\n \\xa0 45 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nmore significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include: \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Revenue Recognition;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Business Combinations;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Goodwill and Intangible Assets\\x97Impairment Assessments; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Accounting for Income Taxes; and  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Legal and Other Contingencies.  In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management\\x92s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which\\nmanagement\\x92s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. Our senior management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of\\nthe Board of Directors.  Revenue Recognition  Our sources of revenues include:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n cloud and on-premise software revenues, which include the sale of: new software licenses, which generally grant to customers a perpetual right to use\\nour database, middleware, applications and industry-specific software products; cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings, which grant customers access to a broad range of our software and related support offerings on a subscription basis in a secure,\\nstandards-based cloud computing environment; cloud IaaS offerings, which grant customers access to infrastructure cloud services to perform elastic compute, storage and networking services, and also provide management services for software and\\nhardware and related IT infrastructure, both generally on a subscription basis; and software license updates and product support offerings (described further below); \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n hardware revenues, which include the sale of hardware products including Oracle Engineered Systems, computer servers, storage products, networking and\\ndata center fabric products, and industry-specific hardware; and hardware support revenues (described further below); and  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n services revenues, which are earned from providing software and hardware related services including consulting, advanced customer support and education\\nservices.  Revenues generally are recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to\\ngovernmental authorities.  Revenue Recognition for Software Products and Software Related Services (Software Elements) \\nNew software licenses revenues primarily represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database, middleware, application and\\nindustry-specific software products and exclude cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues and revenues derived from software license updates, which are included in software license updates and product support revenues. The basis for our new software licenses\\nrevenue recognition is substantially governed by the accounting guidance contained in ASC 985-605, Software-Revenue Recognition. We exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software and\\nsoftware related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period.  For software license arrangements that do not require\\nsignificant modification or customization of the underlying software, we recognize new software licenses revenues when: (1) we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software; (2) we deliver the products; (3) the\\nsale price is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties; and (4) collection is probable. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met, are recognized when those\\nconditions are subsequently met. \\n \\xa0 46 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Substantially all of our software license arrangements do not include acceptance provisions. However, if\\nacceptance provisions exist as part of public policy (for example, in agreements with government entities where acceptance periods are required by law, or within previously executed terms and conditions that are referenced in the current agreement\\nand are short-term in nature), we generally recognize revenues upon delivery provided the acceptance terms are perfunctory and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. If acceptance provisions are not perfunctory (for example,\\nacceptance provisions that are long-term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement), revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period. \\nThe vast majority of our software license arrangements include software license updates and product support contracts, which are entered into at the\\ncustomer\\x92s option, and the related fees are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement, typically one year. Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and\\npatches released during the term of the support period. Product support includes internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel. Software license updates and product support contracts\\nare generally priced as a percentage of the net new software licenses fees and are generally invoiced in full at the beginning of the support term. Substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts\\nannually.  Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements\\x97Software Products and Software Related Services (Software\\nArrangements)  We often enter into arrangements with customers that purchase both software related products and software related services\\nfrom us at the same time, or within close proximity of one another (referred to as software related multiple-element arrangements). Such software related multiple-element arrangements include the sale of our software products, software license\\nupdates and product support contracts and other software related services whereby software license delivery is followed by the subsequent or contemporaneous delivery of the other elements. For those software related multiple-element arrangements, we\\nhave applied the residual method to determine the amount of new software license revenues to be recognized pursuant to ASC 985-605. Under the residual method, if fair value exists for undelivered elements in a multiple-element arrangement, such fair\\nvalue of the undelivered elements is deferred with the remaining portion of the arrangement consideration generally recognized upon delivery of the software license. We allocate the fair value of each element of a software related multiple-element\\narrangement based upon its fair value as determined by our vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE\\x97described further below), with any remaining amount allocated to the software license.  Revenue Recognition for Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS Offerings, Hardware Products, Hardware Support and Related Services (Non-software Elements) \\nOur revenue recognition policy for non-software deliverables including cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, hardware products, support and related\\nservices is based upon the accounting guidance contained in ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition, Multiple-Element Arrangements, and we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of cloud SaaS,\\nPaaS and IaaS revenues, hardware products revenues, support and related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period.  Revenues\\nfrom the sales of our non-software elements are recognized when: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) we deliver the products and passage of the title to the buyer occurs; (3) the sale price is fixed or determinable; and (4)\\ncollection is reasonably assured. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met. When applicable, we reduce revenues for estimated returns\\nor certain other incentive programs where we have the ability to sufficiently estimate the effects of these items. Where an arrangement is subject to acceptance criteria and the acceptance provisions are not perfunctory (for example, acceptance\\nprovisions that are long-term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement), revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period. \\n \\xa0 47 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings generally provide customers access to certain of our software within a\\ncloud-based IT environment that we manage, host and support and offer to customers on a subscription basis. Revenues for our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings are generally recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date the service\\nis made available to customers and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied.  Our cloud IaaS offerings provide infrastructure\\ncloud services and also include deployment and management offerings for software and hardware and related IT infrastructure. Our cloud IaaS offerings are generally sold on a subscription basis and revenues for these cloud IaaS offerings are\\ngenerally recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date the service is made available to customers and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied.  Revenues from the sale of hardware products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of our Oracle Engineered Systems, computer servers, storage, networking and industry-specific hardware and are\\nrecognized upon the delivery of the hardware product to the customer provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied.  Our\\nhardware support offerings generally provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products and can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical\\nsupport services. Hardware support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees. Hardware support contracts are entered into at the customer\\x92s option and are recognized ratably over the contractual term of\\nthe arrangements, which is typically one year, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied.  Revenue Recognition\\nfor Multiple-Element Arrangements\\x97Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS Offerings, Hardware Products, Hardware Support and Related Services (Non-software Arrangements)  We enter into arrangements with customers that purchase non-software related products and services from us at the same time, or within close proximity of one another (referred to as non-software\\nmultiple-element arrangements). Each element within a non-software multiple-element arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting provided the following criteria are met: the delivered products or services have value to the customer\\non a standalone basis; and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services, delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service is considered probable and is substantially\\ncontrolled by us. We consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by us or another vendor or could be resold by the customer. Further, our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right\\nof return relative to the delivered products. Where the aforementioned criteria for a separate unit of accounting are not met, the deliverable is combined with the undelivered element(s) and treated as a single unit of accounting for the purposes of\\nallocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition. For those units of accounting that include more than one deliverable but are treated as a single unit of accounting, we generally recognize revenues over the contractual period of\\nthe arrangement, or in the case of our cloud offerings, we generally recognize revenues over the contractual term of the cloud software subscription. For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit\\nof accounting, we allocate revenue to the respective revenue line items within our consolidated statements of operations based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of relative selling prices of such\\nelements. For our non-software multiple-element arrangements, we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy at the\\narrangement\\x92s inception. The selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy: VSOE if available, third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE\\nare available (a description as to how we determine VSOE, TPE and ESP is provided below). If a tangible hardware product includes software, we determine whether the tangible hardware product and the software work together to deliver the\\nproduct\\x92s essential functionality and, if so, the entire product is treated as a non-software deliverable. The total arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the non-software deliverables using the\\nrelative selling prices of each unit based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. We limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional products or services or\\nmeeting of any specified performance conditions. \\n \\xa0 48 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n When possible, we establish VSOE of selling price for deliverables in software and non-software\\nmultiple-element arrangements using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and for software license updates and product support and hardware support, based on the renewal rates offered to customers. TPE is established by evaluating\\nsimilar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated customers. If we are unable to determine the selling price because VSOE or TPE does not exist, we determine ESP for the purposes of\\nallocating the arrangement by reviewing historical transactions, including transactions whereby the deliverable was sold on a standalone basis and considering several other external and internal factors including, but not limited to, pricing\\npractices including discounting, margin objectives, competition, contractually stated prices, the geographies in which we offer our products and services, the type of customer (i.e., distributor, value-added reseller, government agency and direct\\nend user, among others) and the stage of the product lifecycle. The determination of ESP is made through consultation with and approval by our management, taking into consideration our pricing model and go-to-market strategy. As our, or our\\ncompetitors\\x92, pricing and go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes to our determination of VSOE, TPE and ESP. As a result, our future revenue recognition for\\nmultiple-element arrangements could differ materially from our results in the current period. Selling prices are analyzed on an annual basis or more frequently if we experience significant changes in our selling prices. \\nRevenue Recognition Policies Applicable to both Software and Non-software Elements  Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements\\x97Arrangements with Software and Non-software Elements  We also enter into multiple-element arrangements that may include a combination of our various software related and non-software related products and services offerings including new software licenses,\\nsoftware license updates and product support, cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, hardware products, hardware support, consulting, advanced customer support services and education. In such arrangements, we first allocate the total arrangement\\nconsideration based on the relative selling prices of the software group of elements as a whole and to the non-software elements. We then further allocate consideration within the software group to the respective elements within that group following\\nthe guidance in ASC 985-605 and our policies as described above. After the arrangement consideration has been allocated to the elements, we account for each respective element in the arrangement as described above. \\nOther Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to Software and Non-software Elements  Many of our software arrangements include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts and are included as a part of our services business. Consulting revenues\\nfrom these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from new software licenses revenues because the arrangements qualify as services transactions as defined in ASC 985-605. The more significant factors considered in determining whether\\nthe revenues should be accounted for separately include the nature of services (i.e., consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product), degree of risk, availability of services from other vendors,\\ntiming of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee. Revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed. If there is a significant uncertainty about\\nthe project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services, revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved. We estimate the proportional performance on contracts with fixed or \\x93not to exceed\\x94 fees on a\\nmonthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project. If we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion, revenues are recognized when we receive final acceptance\\nfrom the customer that the services have been completed. When total cost estimates exceed revenues, we accrue for the estimated losses immediately using cost estimates that are based upon an average fully burdened daily rate applicable to the\\nconsulting organization delivering the services. The complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affects the\\namounts of revenues and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements. A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing\\nrequirement changes. \\n \\xa0 49 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Our advanced customer support services are offered as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements\\nto customers buying other software and non-software products and services. We offer these advanced support services, both on-premise and remote, to Oracle customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their products and\\nservices. Depending upon the nature of the arrangement, revenues from these services are recognized as the services are performed or ratably over the term of the service period, which is generally one year or less. \\nEducation revenues are also a part of our services business and include instructor-led, media-based and internet-based training in the use of our software\\nand hardware products. Education revenues are recognized as the classes or other education offerings are delivered.  If an arrangement contains\\nmultiple elements and does not qualify for separate accounting for the product and service transactions, then new software licenses revenues and/or hardware products revenues, including the costs of hardware products, are generally recognized\\ntogether with the services based on contract accounting using either the percentage-of-completion or completed-contract method. For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we\\nallocate revenues to software and non-software elements based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of the relative selling price of such elements. We also evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing \\x93fiscal funding\\x94 or \\x93termination for convenience\\x94 provisions, when such provisions are required by law, to determine\\nthe probability of possible cancellation. We consider multiple factors, including the history with the customer in similar transactions, the \\x93essential use\\x94 of the software or hardware products and the planning, budgeting and approval\\nprocesses undertaken by the governmental entity. If we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is remote, we then recognize revenues once all of the criteria described above have been met. If such a\\ndetermination cannot be made, revenues are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity.  We assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenues if all other revenue recognition requirements are met. Our standard payment terms are net 30 days. However,\\npayment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed. We evaluate non-standard payment terms based on whether we have successful collection history on comparable arrangements (based upon similarity of customers, products,\\nand license economics) and, if so, generally conclude such payment terms are fixed and determinable and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition. While most of our arrangements for sales within our businesses include short-term payment terms, we have a standard practice of providing long-term financing to creditworthy customers primarily through\\nour financing division. Since fiscal 1989, when our financing division was formed, we have established a history of collection, without concessions, on these receivables with payment terms that generally extend up to five years from the contract\\ndate. Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, we recognize new software licenses revenues and hardware products revenues for these arrangements upon delivery, net of any payment discounts from financing transactions. We have\\ngenerally sold receivables financed through our financing division on a non-recourse basis to third-party financing institutions within 90 days of the contracts\\x92 dates of execution and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows\\nfrom operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We account for the sales of these receivables as \\x93true sales\\x94 as defined in ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing, as we are considered to have surrendered control\\nof these financing receivables.  Our customers include several of our suppliers and, occasionally, we have purchased goods or services for our\\noperations from these vendors at or about the same time that we have sold our products to these same companies (Concurrent Transactions). Software license agreements, sales of hardware or sales of services that occur within a three-month time period\\nfrom the date we have purchased goods or services from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure. When we acquire goods or services from a customer, we negotiate the purchase separately from any sales\\ntransaction, at terms we consider to be at arm\\x92s length and settle the purchase in cash. We recognize revenues from Concurrent Transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are met and the goods and services acquired are necessary for\\nour current operations. \\n \\xa0 50 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Business Combinations  We apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, in accounting for our acquisitions. It requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed\\nat the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our\\nbest estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a\\nresult, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement\\nperiod or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. \\nAccounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, including\\nour estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, pre-acquisition contingencies and contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and\\nappropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.  Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include but are not limited to:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n future expected cash flows from software license sales, cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS contracts, hardware product sales, support agreements, consulting\\ncontracts, other customer contracts, acquired developed technologies and patents;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when\\ncompleted;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the acquired company\\x92s brand and competitive position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used\\nin the combined company\\x92s product portfolio; and  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n discount rates. \\nUnanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.\\nWe estimate the fair values of our cloud SaaS and PaaS, software license updates and product support, and hardware support obligations assumed. The\\nestimated fair values of these performance obligations are determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. The\\nestimated costs to fulfill the obligations are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services including the correction of any errors in the products acquired. The sum of these costs and operating profit approximates, in\\ntheory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the performance obligations. We do not include any costs associated with selling efforts or research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs.\\nProfit associated with any selling efforts is excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded those selling efforts on the performance obligations prior to the acquisition date. We also do not include the estimated research and\\ndevelopment costs in our fair value determinations, as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition. As a result of our fair value estimates for these obligations, we did not recognize certain cloud SaaS and\\nPaaS, software license updates and product support and hardware support revenue amounts that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities upon delivery of the contractual obligations (refer to\\n\\x93Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges\\x94 below for further discussion). Historically, substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software license updates and product support\\ncontracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal, and we strive to renew cloud SaaS and PaaS contracts and hardware support contracts. To the extent \\n \\xa0 51 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\ncustomers to which these contractual obligations pertain renew these contracts with us, we expect to recognize revenues for the full contracts\\x92 values over the respective contracts\\x92\\nrenewal periods.  In connection with a business combination or other strategic initiative, we may estimate costs associated with restructuring\\nplans committed to by our management. Restructuring costs are typically comprised of employee severance costs, costs of consolidating duplicate facilities and contract termination costs. Restructuring expenses are based upon plans that have been\\ncommitted to by our management, but may be refined in subsequent periods. We account for costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company separately from the business combination pursuant to ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost\\nObligations. A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred. When estimating the fair\\nvalue of facility restructuring activities, assumptions are applied regarding estimated sub-lease payments to be received, which can differ materially from actual results. This may require us to revise our initial estimates which may materially\\naffect our results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made.  For a given acquisition, we may identify certain\\npre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these\\ncontingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts. \\nIf we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a pre-acquisition contingency (non-income tax related) by the end of the measurement period, which is\\ngenerally the case given the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (1) it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and (2) the\\namount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent to the measurement period, changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial\\nposition.  In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are\\ninitially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified\\nwithin the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance\\x92s or contingency\\x92s estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related\\nvaluation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. \\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\\x97Impairment Assessments  We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles\\x97Goodwill and\\nOther. According to ASC 350, we can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting unit\\x92s goodwill for impairment or we can directly perform the two-step impairment test. Based on our qualitative assessment, if we determine\\nthat the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) to be less than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test prescribed by ASC 350 will be performed. In the first step, we compare the\\nfair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further\\ntesting. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting\\nunit\\x92s goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit\\x92s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference.  Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to\\ncalculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions and the determination of appropriate market comparables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable\\n\\n \\xa0 52 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nbut that are inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to\\ndetermine the carrying values for each of our reporting units.  Our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis, which was performed on\\nMarch 1, 2016, did not result in a goodwill impairment charge, nor did we recognize an impairment charge in fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2015, we recognized an impairment charge of $186 million in our hardware products reporting unit (refer to Note 7 of\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information).  Other than our consulting\\nreporting unit, all of our other reporting units had fair values that substantially exceeded their carrying values based on our most recent annual goodwill impairment review. Our consulting reporting unit had $1.8 billion of goodwill on March 1,\\n2016, and experienced revenue and operating margin declines in fiscal 2016. As of our most recent annual goodwill impairment review, our consulting reporting unit\\x92s fair value was 11% in excess of its carrying value. We estimate that should our\\nconsulting reporting unit\\x92s projected margins and related cash flows unfavorably deviate from our projections by 20% or more each year, our consulting reporting unit likely would incur a goodwill impairment loss. \\nWe make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an\\nimpairment may exist. Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. Recoverability of finite\\nlived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. We review indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events\\nor changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. If the asset is considered to be\\nimpaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. \\nAssumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a\\nvariety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Although we believe the historical assumptions and estimates we have made\\nare reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results. We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014. \\nAccounting for Income Taxes \\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many\\ntransactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities, the process of identifying items of revenues\\nand expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment and segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of these matters could be\\ndifferent from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made. \\nOur effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are\\nplanned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Remittances of foreign earnings to the United States are planned based on projected cash flow, working capital and investment needs of our foreign and domestic operations. Based on\\nthese assumptions, we estimate the amount that will be distributed to the United States and provide U.S. federal taxes on these amounts. Material changes in our estimates as to how much of our foreign earnings will be distributed to the United\\nStates or tax legislation that limits or restricts the amount of undistributed foreign earnings that we consider indefinitely reinvested outside the United States could materially impact our income tax provision and effective tax rate. \\n \\xa0 53 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not\\nto be realized. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We consider future growth, forecasted earnings, future\\ntaxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a\\nvaluation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the\\nperiod in which we make such a determination, or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period. If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the\\nnet deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to earnings at such time.  We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year.\\nAdjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known, which can materially impact our effective tax rate. \\nThe amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments.\\nOur estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. A description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under \\x93Business\\nCombinations\\x94 above. For those tax related contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we account for these uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740, Income Taxes, which contains a two-step approach to recognizing and\\nmeasuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit,\\nincluding resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although we believe that we have\\nadequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a\\ntax audit, judicial rulings, and refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences\\ngenerally will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made. Our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also\\ninclude the related interest and penalties.  In addition, as a part of our accounting for business combinations, intangible assets are\\nrecognized at fair values and goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net estimated fair values of assets acquired. Impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an\\nincreased effective income tax rate in the period that any impairment is recorded. Amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible pursuant to our existing tax structure; however, deferred taxes have\\nbeen recorded for non-deductible amortization expenses as a part of the accounting for business combinations. We have taken into account the allocation of these identified intangibles among different taxing jurisdictions, including those with\\nnominal or zero percent tax rates, in establishing the related deferred tax liabilities.  Legal and Other Contingencies\\n We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and\\nassess our potential financial exposure. A description of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under \\x93Business Combinations\\x94 above. For legal and other contingencies\\nthat are not a part of a business combination, we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required\\nin both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time\\nthe accruals are made. As \\n \\xa0 54 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nadditional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the\\npotential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.  Results of Operations\\n Impact of Acquisitions  The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 and in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was impacted by our recent acquisitions. In our discussion of changes in our\\nresults of operations from fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014, we may qualitatively disclose the impact of our acquired products and services (for the one-year period subsequent to the acquisition date) to\\nthe growth in certain of our operating segments\\x92 revenues where such qualitative discussions would be meaningful for an understanding of the factors that influenced the changes in our results of operations. When material, we may also provide\\nquantitative disclosures related to such acquired products and services. Expenses for each of the respective period comparisons generally were not separately identifiable due to the integration of these businesses and operating segments into our\\nexisting operations, and/or were insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented.  We caution readers that, while pre-\\nand post-acquisition comparisons, as well as any quantified amounts themselves, may provide indications of general trends, any acquisition information that we provide has inherent limitations for the following reasons: \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n any qualitative and quantitative disclosures cannot specifically address or quantify the substantial effects attributable to changes in business\\nstrategies, including our sales force integration efforts. We believe that if our acquired companies had operated independently and sales forces had not been integrated, the relative mix of products and services sold would have been different; and\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n although substantially all of our on-premise software license customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software license\\nupdates and product support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal, and we strive to renew cloud SaaS and PaaS contracts and hardware support contracts, the amounts shown as cloud SaaS and PaaS deferred revenues, software license\\nupdates and product support deferred revenues, and hardware support deferred revenues in our \\x93Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges\\x94 (presented below) are not necessarily indicative of revenue improvements we will achieve upon\\ncontract renewals to the extent customers do not renew.  Constant Currency Presentation \\nOur international operations have provided and are expected to continue to provide a significant portion of each of our segments\\x92 revenues and\\nexpenses. As a result, each segment\\x92s revenues and expenses and our total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major international currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how\\nour underlying businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Annual Report using constant currency disclosure. To present this\\ninformation, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e., the rates in effect on May 31, 2015, which was the last day of\\nour prior fiscal year) rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. For example, if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0 million Euros from products sold on May 31, 2016 and 2015, our financial\\nstatements would reflect reported revenues of $1.12 million in fiscal 2016 (using 1.12 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period) and $1.08 million in fiscal 2015 (using 1.08 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period). The\\nconstant currency presentation, however, would translate the fiscal 2016 results using the fiscal 2015 exchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during the period. In each of the tables below, we present the percent change\\nbased on actual, unrounded results in reported currency and in constant currency. \\n \\xa0 55 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n

results of operations for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 were significantly impacted by movements in international\\ncurrencies relative to the U.S. Dollar, which decreased our total revenues by 5 percentage points, total operating expenses by 4 percentage points and total operating margin by 7 percentage points. \\nExcluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations, our total revenues increased in fiscal 2016 due to constant currency growth in our cloud\\nand on-premise software business revenues and services business revenues. The constant currency growth in our cloud and on-premise software business revenues during fiscal 2016 was attributable to growth in our software license updates and product\\nsupport revenues, growth in our SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues, and revenue contributions from our recent acquisitions and was partially offset by fiscal 2016 decreases in our new software licenses revenues. The constant currency growth in our\\nservices business revenues was primarily attributable to our recent acquisitions. These constant currency increases in our revenues during fiscal 2016 were partially offset by constant currency decreases in our hardware business revenues. In\\nconstant currency, the EMEA region and the Asia Pacific region contributed approximately equal amounts to our fiscal 2016 total revenues growth and the Americas was flat.  Excluding the effects of favorable currency rate fluctuations, our total operating expenses increased during fiscal 2016 primarily due to increased sales and marketing and research and development\\nexpenses resulting primarily from increased headcount, increased cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS expenses resulting from increased headcount and infrastructure expenses to support the increase in our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues, higher\\nrestructuring expenses that were recorded pursuant to the Fiscal 2015 Oracle Restructuring Plan (2015 Restructuring Plan; see Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report), and higher general and\\nadministrative expenses due to higher headcount and higher professional services fees, primarily legal related fees. These constant currency expense increases were partially offset by fiscal 2016 reductions in expenses associated with certain of our\\nintangible assets that became fully amortized during fiscal 2016 and lower acquisition related and other expenses, which primarily was attributable to higher expenses during fiscal 2015 as a result of a goodwill impairment loss of $186 million (see\\nNote 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information). \\n \\xa0 56 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Excluding the effects of unfavorable foreign currency rate fluctuations, our total operating margin and\\ntotal operating margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2016 as our total expenses increased at a faster rate than our total revenues.  Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our results of operations for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 were significantly impacted by movements in international\\ncurrencies relative to the U.S. Dollar, which decreased our total revenues by 4 percentage points, total operating expenses by 3 percentage points and total operating income by 6 percentage points. \\nExcluding the effects of unfavorable currency variations, our total revenues increased in fiscal 2015 due to revenue increases in our cloud and on-premise\\nsoftware and hardware businesses. The constant currency growth in our cloud and on-premise software revenues was attributable to similar reasons as noted above. The constant currency growth in our hardware business was attributable to growth in our\\nhardware support revenues, which were primarily attributable to revenue contributions from our acquisitions. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas region contributed 69%, the EMEA region contributed 28% and the Asia\\nPacific region contributed 3% to the growth in our total revenues during fiscal 2015.  Excluding the effects of favorable currency variations,\\nour total operating expenses increased during fiscal 2015 due to expense increases across all of our lines of business, the largest of which were due to increased sales and marketing and research and development expenses resulting primarily from\\nincreased headcount, increased cloud SaaS and PaaS expenses to support the increase in our cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues, and increased acquisition related and other expenses that was primarily attributable to the goodwill impairment charge as noted\\nabove.  Excluding the effects of unfavorable foreign currency rate fluctuations, our fiscal 2015 operating margin was flat in comparison to the\\nprior year, while our operating margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2015 as our total operating expenses increased at a faster rate than our total revenues.

and on-premise software segment decreased by 1 percentage point during fiscal 2016 due to a reduction in new software licenses revenues, partially offset by an increase in cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues\\nand incremental revenue contributions from our recent acquisitions. The increase in our cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues and decrease in our new software licenses revenues during fiscal 2016 were primarily due to the strategic emphasis placed on\\nselling, marketing and growing our cloud software offerings and we expect these revenue trends will continue. In constant currency, fiscal 2016 revenue declines in the Americas region were partially offset by revenues growth in the EMEA and Asia\\nPacific regions.  In reported currency, new software licenses revenues earned from transactions of $3 million or greater decreased by 24% in\\nfiscal 2016 and represented 28% of our new software licenses revenues in fiscal 2016 in comparison to 31% in fiscal 2015. \\n \\xa0 59 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Excluding the effects of favorable currency rate fluctuations of 5 percentage points, total cloud software\\nand on-premise software expenses increased during fiscal 2016 primarily due to higher employee related expenses from increased headcount and higher cloud SaaS and PaaS expenses incurred to support the related revenues increase. These fiscal 2016\\nconstant currency expense increases were partially offset by a reduction in expenses associated with certain of our intangible assets that became fully amortized.  Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations, our cloud software and on-premise software segment\\x92s total margin and total margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal\\n2016 due primarily to growth in our total expenses for this operating segment.  Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal\\n2014:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations, cloud software and on-premise software revenues were flat during fiscal 2015 as growth in our cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues and contributions from\\nour acquisitions were offset by a decline in our new software licenses revenues. Similar to the fiscal 2016 trend noted above, the increase in our cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues and decrease in our new software licenses revenues during fiscal 2015\\nwere primarily due to the strategic emphasis placed on selling, marketing and growing our cloud software offerings. In constant currency, fiscal 2015 revenue growth in the Americas region was offset by revenue declines in the EMEA and Asia Pacific\\nregions.  In reported currency, new software licenses revenues earned from transactions of $3 million or greater decreased by 15% in fiscal\\n2015 and represented 31% of our new software licenses revenues in fiscal 2015 in comparison to 33% in fiscal 2014.  Excluding the effects of\\nfavorable currency rate fluctuations, total cloud software and on-premise software expenses increased in fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher employee related expenses from increased headcount, higher variable compensation expenses, and higher cloud\\nSaaS and PaaS expenses incurred to support the related revenues increase.  Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations, our\\ncloud software and on-premise software segment\\x92s total margin and total margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2015 due primarily to the growth in our total expenses during fiscal 2015 for this operating segment. \\nCloud Infrastructure as a Service:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our cloud IaaS segment provides infrastructure cloud services that are\\nenterprise-grade, hosted and supported within the Oracle Cloud to perform elastic compute, storage and networking services on a subscription basis. Our cloud IaaS segment also offers Oracle Managed Cloud Services, which are comprehensive software\\nand hardware management and maintenance services for customer IT infrastructure for a fee for a stated term that are hosted at our Oracle data center facilities, select partner data centers or physically on-premise at customer facilities. Cloud IaaS\\nexpenses consist primarily of personnel related expenditures, technology infrastructure expenditures and facilities costs. Operating expenses associated with our IaaS offerings also include sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel\\nrelated, and amortization of intangible assets. For all periods presented, our cloud IaaS segment\\x92s revenues and expenses were substantially attributable to our Oracle Managed Cloud Services offerings. \\n \\xa0 60 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of

support revenues increased during fiscal 2016 as a result of substantially all customers electing to purchase software support contracts in conjunction with their new software licenses purchased during\\nthe trailing 4-quarter period, and due to the renewal of substantially all of the software support customer base eligible for renewal during the trailing 4-quarter period and incremental revenues from our recent acquisitions. Excluding the effects\\nof currency rate fluctuations, the Americas region contributed 56%, the EMEA region contributed 26% and the Asia Pacific region contributed 18% to the increase in software license updates and product support revenues during fiscal 2016. \\nExcluding the effects of favorable foreign currency rate fluctuations of 3 percentage points, total software license updates and product support expenses\\ndecreased during fiscal 2016 primarily due to a reduction in expenses associated with certain of our intangible assets that became fully amortized.  In constant currency, total margin and margin as a percentage of revenues increased in fiscal 2016 due to the growth in total revenues and the decrease in total expenses for this segment. \\nFiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations of 4 percentage\\npoints, software license updates and product support revenues increased during fiscal 2015 relative to fiscal 2014 due to similar reasons as noted above for the fiscal 2016 increase. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas\\nregion contributed 50%, the EMEA region contributed 36% and the Asia Pacific region contributed 14% to the increase in software license updates and product support revenues during fiscal 2015.  Excluding the effects of favorable foreign currency rate fluctuations of 3 percentage points, total software license updates and product support expenses increased during fiscal 2015 due to higher\\nemployee related expenses and facilities costs associated with increased headcount that was primarily attributable to acquisitions, and also due to \\n \\xa0 62 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nhigher bad debt expenses. These fiscal 2015 expense increases were partially offset by fiscal 2015 expense decreases related to lower statutory obligation expenses in the jurisdictions in which\\nwe operate and lower amortization of intangible assets.  In constant currency, total margin and margin as a percentage of revenues for this\\nsegment increased in fiscal 2015 as our total revenues increased at a faster rate than our total expenses for this segment.  Hardware\\nBusiness  Our hardware business consists of our hardware products segment and hardware support segment. \\nHardware Products:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Hardware products revenues are primarily generated from the sales of our Oracle Engineered\\nSystems, computer server, storage, networking, workstations and related devices and industry-specific hardware products. We market and sell our hardware products through our direct sales force and indirect channels such as independent distributors\\nand value-added resellers. Operating expenses associated with our hardware products include the cost of hardware products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our internal manufacturing operations or\\nby third-party manufacturers, warranty expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the impact of inventory determined to be excess and obsolete. Operating expenses associated with our hardware products also include\\nsales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include variable compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of our hardware products, and amortization of intangible assets.

percentage points, total hardware products revenues decreased during fiscal 2016 due to reductions in sales volumes of certain of our product lines, including lower margin products. This decrease was\\npartially offset by incremental revenues during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 from our recently acquired companies, primarily MICROS. On a constant currency basis, fiscal 2016 total hardware products revenues declines in the Americas and EMEA\\nregions were partially offset by slight growth in the Asia Pacific region.  Excluding the effects of favorable currency rate fluctuations of 6\\npercentage points, total hardware products expenses decreased in fiscal 2016 due to lower hardware products costs associated with lower hardware products revenues, and due to a reduction in expenses associated with certain of our intangible assets\\nthat became fully amortized.  In constant currency, total margin and total margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2016 for this\\nsegment due to the decrease in our total revenues.  Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Excluding the\\neffects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations, total hardware products revenues were flat in fiscal 2015 as revenues from acquired companies, including MICROS, and increases in hardware revenues attributable to our Oracle Engineered Systems\\nproducts were offset by reductions in the sales volumes of certain of our other hardware product offerings. On a constant currency basis, revenue increases in the Americas and EMEA regions were offset by revenue declines in the Asia Pacific region\\nduring fiscal 2015.  Excluding the effects of favorable currency rate fluctuations, total hardware products expenses decreased in fiscal 2015\\nprimarily due to lower bad debt expenses and a reduction in amortization of intangible assets. These fiscal 2015 expense decreases were partially offset by higher fiscal 2015 employee related expenses due to increased headcount from our acquisitions\\nand higher direct product costs that were primarily attributable to acquired products revenues.  In constant currency, total margin and margin\\nas a percentage of revenues increased in fiscal 2015 due to the decrease in total expenses for this segment.  Hardware\\nSupport:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our hardware support offerings provide customers with software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products, such as Oracle Solaris and certain other\\nsoftware products, and can include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Expenses associated with our hardware support operating segment include the cost of materials used to repair customer products, the cost of\\nproviding support services, largely personnel related expenses, and the amortization of our intangible assets primarily associated with hardware support contracts and customer relationships obtained from our acquisitions. \\n \\xa0 64

Future effective tax rates could\\nbe adversely affected if earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates, by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations or by adverse rulings in tax related litigation. \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nYear Ended May 31,\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nPercent Change\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nPercent Change\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n (Dollars in millions)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2016\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nActual\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nConstant\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2015\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nActual\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nConstant\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2014\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Provision for income taxes\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02,541\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n-12%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n-5%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02,896\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n5%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n13%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02,749\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Effective tax rate\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n22.2%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n22.6%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n20.1%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Provision for income taxes in fiscal 2016\\ndecreased, relative to the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2015, due in substantial part to lower net income before provision for income taxes during fiscal 2016, settlements with certain tax authorities, and the retroactive extension of the\\nU.S. research and development tax credit, which collectively were partially offset by unfavorable changes in the jurisdictional mix of our earnings during fiscal 2016.

These unfavorable working\\ncapital movements were partially offset by the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal 2016 and cash proceeds from fiscal 2016 stock option exercises. \\nThe increase in working capital as of May 31, 2015 in comparison to May 31, 2014 was primarily due to our issuance of $20.0 billion of long-term senior\\nnotes during fiscal 2015, the favorable impact to our net current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal 2015 and, to a lesser extent, cash proceeds from stock option exercises. These working capital increases were partially offset by\\n$6.2 billion of net cash used for our acquisitions of MICROS and others, $8.1 billion of cash used for repurchases of our common stock, the reclassification of $2.0 billion of senior notes that were due in January 2016 from long-term to current, and\\n$2.3 billion of cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders, all of which occurred during fiscal 2015.  Our working capital may be impacted\\nby some or all of the aforementioned factors in future periods, the amounts and timing of which are variable. \\n \\xa0 70 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Cash and cash\\nequivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper and other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities consist of Tier-1 commercial paper debt securities, corporate debt\\nsecurities and certain other securities. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2016 in comparison to May 31, 2015 was primarily due to cash inflows generated by our operations during fiscal 2016, $1.8 billion of\\nnet cash inflows from fiscal 2016 debt issuances, net of debt repayments, and cash inflows from fiscal 2016 stock option exercises. These fiscal 2016 cash inflows were partially offset by fiscal 2016 cash outflows of $10.4 billion for repurchases of\\nour common stock, $2.5 billion for the fiscal 2016 payment of cash dividends to our stockholders, and $1.2 billion for fiscal 2016 capital expenditures. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities included $48.2 billion held by our foreign\\nsubsidiaries as of May 31, 2016. We consider $42.6 billion of our undistributed earnings as indefinitely reinvested in our foreign operations outside the United States. These undistributed earnings would be subject to U.S. income tax if repatriated\\nto the United States. Assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits, the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings would be approximately $13.3 billion as of May 31, 2016 should the amounts be repatriated\\nto the United States. The amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances held by our foreign subsidiaries is\\nsubject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated\\nbalance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report). As the U.S. Dollar generally strengthened against certain major international currencies during\\nfiscal 2016, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for these subsidiaries decreased on a net basis as of May 31, 2016 relative to what we would have reported using constant currency rates\\nfrom our May 31, 2015 balance sheet date.  The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2015 in comparison to\\nMay 31, 2014 was due to an increase in cash generated from our fiscal 2015 operating activities, our issuance of $20.0 billion of senior notes in fiscal 2015, and to a lesser extent, cash proceeds from fiscal 2015 stock option exercises. These\\nfiscal 2015 cash inflows were partially offset by fiscal 2015 cash outflows of $6.2 billion of net cash paid for our acquisitions of MICROS and others, $8.1 billion of fiscal 2015 repurchases of our common stock, the repayment of $1.5 billion of\\nsenior notes and $2.3 billion used for the payment of fiscal 2015 cash dividends to our stockholders. Additionally, our reported cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of May 31, 2015 decreased on a net basis in comparison to\\nMay 31, 2014 as the U.S. Dollar generally strengthened in comparison to most major international currencies during fiscal 2015.  Days sales\\noutstanding, which we calculate by dividing period end accounts receivable by average daily sales for the quarter, was 46 days at May 31, 2016 compared with 47 days at May 31, 2015. The days sales outstanding calculation excludes the impact of any\\nrevenue adjustments resulting from business combinations that reduced our acquired cloud SaaS and PaaS obligations, software license updates and product support obligations and hardware support obligations to fair value. \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nYear Ended May 31,\\n\\xa0\\n\\n (Dollars in millions)\\n\\xa0\\n2016\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nChange\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2015\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nChange\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2014\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Net cash provided by operating activities\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n13,561\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n-5%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n14,336\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n-4%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n14,921\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Net cash used for investing activities\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(5,154\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n-73%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(19,047\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n153%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(7,539\\n)\\xa0\\n\\n Net cash (used for) provided by financing activities\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n(9,856\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n200%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n9,850\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n342%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n(4,068\\n)\\xa0\\n Cash flows from operating activities:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our largest source of operating cash flows is\\ncash collections from our customers following the purchase and renewal of their software license updates and product support agreements. Payments from customers for these support agreements are generally received near the beginning of the\\ncontracts\\x92 terms, which are generally one year in length. Over the course of a fiscal year, we also have historically generated cash from the sales of new software licenses, cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings, hardware products, hardware support\\narrangements, and services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee related expenditures, material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware products, taxes and leased facilities. \\n \\xa0 71 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Net cash provided by operating activities decreased in fiscal 2016 and 2015 primarily due to the cash\\nunfavorable effects of lower net income and the related unfavorable currency rate fluctuations on our net income in each fiscal year relative to the corresponding prior year period.  Cash flows from investing activities:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to our acquisitions, the timing of our purchases, maturities\\nand sales of our investments in marketable debt securities and investments in capital and other assets, including certain intangible assets, to support our growth.  Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Net cash used for investing activities decreased in fiscal 2016 relative to fiscal 2015 primarily due to a decrease in net cash used to\\npurchase marketable securities (net of proceeds received from sales and maturities) and a decrease in cash used for acquisitions, net of cash acquired.  Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Net cash used for investing activities increased in fiscal 2015 relative to fiscal 2014 primarily due to an increase in cash used for\\nacquisitions, net of cash acquired, and an increase in net cash used to purchase marketable securities (net of proceeds received from sales and maturities).  Cash flows from financing activities:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and repayments related to our debt instruments\\nas well as stock repurchases, dividend payments and net proceeds related to employee stock programs.  Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal\\n2015:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We used net cash for financing activities of $9.9 billion during fiscal 2016 in comparison to net cash provided by financing activities of $9.9 billion during fiscal 2015. Cash used in financing activities during\\nfiscal 2016 was primarily due to cash outflows of $10.4 billion for fiscal 2016 common stock repurchases and $2.5 billion for fiscal 2016 dividend payments, partially offset by $1.8 billion of cash inflows from fiscal 2016 debt issuances, net of\\nrepayments. Cash provided by financing activities of $9.9 billion during fiscal 2015 was primarily due to $18.3 billion of net cash inflows from fiscal 2015 debt issuances, net of repayments, partially offset by $8.1 billion of cash used for fiscal\\n2015 common stock repurchases and $2.3 billion of cash used for fiscal 2015 dividend payments.  Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal\\n2014:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2015 increased in comparison to net cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2014 primarily due to a net increase in borrowings in fiscal 2015 as well as lower\\nstock repurchase activity during fiscal 2015. These favorable impacts to our financing cash flows during fiscal 2015 were partially offset by the repayment of $1.5 billion of borrowings pursuant to senior notes maturities during fiscal 2015 (no\\nrepayments during fiscal 2014).  Free cash flow:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a\\nGAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to analyze cash flows generated from our operations. We believe free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors.\\nThe presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We\\ncalculate free cash flow as follows:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nYear Ended May 31,\\n\\xa0\\n\\n (Dollars in millions)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2016\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nChange\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2015\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nChange\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2014\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Net cash provided by operating activities\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa013,561\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n-5%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa014,336\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n-4%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa014,921\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Capital expenditures\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(1,189\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n-15%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(1,391\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n140%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(580\\n)\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Free cash flow\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n12,372\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n-4%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n12,945\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n-10%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n14,341\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Net income\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n8,901\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n9,938\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n10,955\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Free cash flow as percent of net income\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n139%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n130%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n131%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n \\xa0 72 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Long-Term Customer Financing:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We offer certain of our customers the\\noption to acquire our software products, hardware products and services offerings through separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis to financial\\ninstitutions within 90 days of the contracts\\x92 dates of execution. We generally record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control\\nof these financing receivables. We financed $1.2 billion in fiscal 2016, and $1.6 billion in each of fiscal 2015 and 2014, or approximately 16%, 19% and 17%, respectively, of our new software licenses revenues in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014. We\\nfinanced $159 million, $172 million and $168 million of our hardware products revenues in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, or approximately 6% in each of fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 of our hardware products revenues. \\nRecent Financing Activities: \\nRevolving Credit Agreement:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In May 2016, we entered into three revolving credit agreements with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.,\\nas initial lender and administrative agent (the 2016 Credit Agreements) and borrowed $3.8 billion pursuant to these agreements. The 2016 Credit Agreements provided us with short-term borrowings for working capital and other general corporate\\npurposes. Interest for the 2016 Credit Agreements is based on either (1) a LIBOR-based formula or (2) the Base Rate formula, each as set forth in the 2016 Credit Agreements. The borrowings are due and payable on June 27, 2016, which is the\\ntermination date of the 2016 Credit Agreements. Additional details regarding the 2016 Credit Agreements are included in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. \\nSenior Notes:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In January 2016, our $2.0 billion 5.25% senior notes due January 2016 matured and were repaid. \\nCash Dividends:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In fiscal 2016, we declared and paid cash dividends of $0.60 per share that totaled $2.5 billion. In June\\n2016, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share of our outstanding common stock payable on July 27, 2016 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 6, 2016. Future declarations of dividends and\\nthe establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.  Common Stock\\nRepurchases:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On March 15, 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors approved an expansion of our stock repurchase program\\nby an additional $10.0 billion. As of May 31, 2016, approximately $8.8 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 271.9 million shares for $10.4 billion, 193.7 million shares for $8.1\\nbillion, and 280.4 million shares for $9.8 billion in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working\\ncapital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations (described further below) or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be\\neffected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time. \\n \\xa0 73 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Contractual Obligations:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The contractual obligations presented in the\\ntable below represent our estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing\\nfrom these estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments.

Principal and interest payments for these senior notes were\\ncalculated and presented in the table above based on the terms of these cross-currency swap agreements.

We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for our hardware products and to perform final assembly and\\ntesting of finished hardware products. We also obtain individual hardware components for our products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and\\nmanufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead-times and/or commercially standard lead-times for the particular part or product and have been included in the amount presented in the above contractual\\nobligations table. Routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to our external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in the ordinary course of business are not included in the amounts\\npresented above, as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way.  In June 2016, we acquired certain companies to expand our cloud industry solutions offerings. These acquisitions were not individually significant. In the aggregate, the estimated total preliminary\\npurchase price was $1.3 billion.  As of May 31, 2016, we had $5.3 billion of gross unrecognized income tax benefits, including related interest\\nand penalties, recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, and all such obligations have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above due to the uncertainty as to when they might be settled. We cannot make a reasonably reliable\\nestimate of the period in which the remainder of our unrecognized income tax benefits will be settled or released with the relevant tax authorities, although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or\\nreleased during fiscal 2017. \\n \\xa0 74 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from\\noperations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures and contractual obligation requirements. In addition, we believe that we could fund any future acquisitions, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt\\nwith our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our\\nfinancial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.  Selected Quarterly Financial Data  Quarterly revenues, expenses and operating income have\\nhistorically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including the structure of sales force incentive compensation plans. In addition, our European operations generally provide lower revenues in our first fiscal quarter because of the\\nreduced economic activity in Europe during the summer. These seasonal factors are common in the technology industry. These factors have caused a decrease in our first quarter revenues as compared to revenues in the immediately preceding fourth\\nquarter, which historically has been our highest revenue quarter within a particular fiscal year. Similarly, the operating income of our business is affected by seasonal factors in a similar manner as our revenues (in particular, our cloud software\\nand on-premise software segment) as certain expenses within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short term. We expect these trends to continue in fiscal 2017.  The following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly information for our last eight fiscal quarters. We believe that all necessary adjustments, which consisted only of normal recurring adjustments,\\nhave been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the results of such periods when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The sum of the quarterly\\nfinancial information may vary from annual data due to rounding.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nFiscal 2016 Quarter Ended (Unaudited)\\n\\xa0\\n\\n (in millions, except per share amounts)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nAugust\\xa031\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nNovember\\xa030\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nFebruary\\xa029\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nMay\\xa031\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Revenues\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n8,448\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n8,993\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n9,012\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa010,594\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Gross profit\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n6,561\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n7,105\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n7,139\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n8,640\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Operating income\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n2,654\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n2,955\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n3,027\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n3,968\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Net income\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n1,747\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n2,197\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n2,142\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n2,814\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Earnings per share\\x97basic\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.40\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.52\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.51\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.68\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Earnings per share\\x97diluted\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.40\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.51\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.50\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.66\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nFiscal 2015 Quarter Ended (Unaudited)\\n\\xa0\\n\\n (in millions, except per share amounts)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nAugust\\xa031\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nNovember\\xa030\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nFebruary\\xa028\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nMay\\xa031\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Revenues\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n8,596\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n9,598\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n9,327\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa010,706\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Gross profit\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n6,878\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n7,657\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n7,394\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n8,611\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Operating income\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n2,963\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n3,542\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n3,383\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n3,982\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Net income\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n2,184\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n2,502\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n2,495\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n2,758\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Earnings per share\\x97basic\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.49\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.57\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.57\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.63\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Earnings per share\\x97diluted\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.48\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.56\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.56\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.62\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n Restricted Stock-Based Awards and Stock Options  Our stock-based compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of\\nexisting stockholders. \\n \\xa0 75 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n We recognize that restricted stock-based awards and stock options dilute existing stockholders and have\\nsought to control the number of stock-based awards granted while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2013 has been a weighted-average annualized rate of 1.6%\\nper year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new restricted stock-based awards or stock options granted and assumed, net of restricted stock-based awards and stock options forfeited by employees leaving the\\ncompany, divided by the weighted-average outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all restricted stock-based awards vest and stock options are exercised. Of the outstanding stock options\\nat May 31, 2016, which generally have a ten-year exercise period, 13.3% have exercise prices higher than the market price of our common stock on such date. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our\\nstock-based compensation program; however, we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future, as we may use our available cash for acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes. At May 31,\\n2016, the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding restricted stock-based awards and unexercised stock options, regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including stock options where the strike price is\\nhigher than the market price as of such date, was 10.3%.  The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviews and approves the\\norganization-wide stock-based award grants to selected employees, all stock-based award grants to executive officers and any individual grant of stock-based awards in excess of 100,000 stock option equivalent shares. A separate Plan Committee, which\\nis an executive officer committee, approves individual stock-based award grants of up to 100,000 stock option equivalent shares to non-executive officers and employees. Restricted stock-based award and stock option activity from June\\n1, 2013 through May 31, 2016 is summarized as follows (shares in millions):  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Restricted stock-based awards and stock options outstanding at May\\xa031, 2013\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n448\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Restricted stock-based awards and stock options granted\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n252\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Restricted stock-based awards and stock options assumed\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n12\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Restricted stock-based awards vested and stock options exercised\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(226\\n)\\xa0\\n\\n Forfeitures, cancellations and other, net\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(59\\n)\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Restricted stock-based awards and stock options outstanding at May\\xa031, 2016\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n427\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Weighted-average annualized restricted stock-based awards and stock options granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and\\ncancellations\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n68\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Weighted-average annualized stock repurchases\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(249\\n)\\xa0\\n\\n Shares outstanding at May\\xa031, 2016\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n4,131\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Basic weighted-average shares outstanding from June\\xa01, 2013 through May\\xa031, 2016\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n4,384\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Restricted stock-based awards and stock options outstanding as a percent of shares outstanding at May\\xa031,\\n2016\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n10.3%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Total restricted stock-based awards and in the money stock options outstanding (based on the closing price of our common stock on\\nthe last trading day of fiscal 2016) as a percent of shares outstanding at May\\xa031, 2016\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n9.1%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Weighted-average annualized restricted stock-based awards and stock options granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and\\ncancellations and before stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted-average shares outstanding from\\xa0June\\xa01, 2013 through May\\xa031, 2016\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n1.6%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Weighted-average annualized restricted stock-based awards and stock options granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and\\ncancellations and after stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted-average shares outstanding from June\\xa01, 2013 through May\\xa031, 2016\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n-4.1%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n Our Compensation Committee approves the annual organization-wide stock-based award grants to certain employees.

Item 7A.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Quantitative and Qualitative\\nDisclosures About Market Risk  Cash, Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities and Interest Income Risk \\nOur bank deposits and time deposits are generally held with large, diverse financial institutions worldwide with high investment-grade credit ratings or\\nfinancial institutions that meet investment-grade ratings criteria, which we believe mitigates credit risk and certain other risks. In addition, as of May 31, 2016, substantially all of our marketable securities are high quality with approximately\\n28% having maturity dates within one year and 72% having maturity dates within one to six years (a description of our marketable securities held is included in Note 3 and Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in\\nthis Annual Report and \\x93Liquidity and Capital Resources\\x94 above). We hold a mix of both fixed and floating-rate debt securities. The fair values of our fixed-rate debt securities are impacted by interest rate movements and if interest rates\\nwould have been higher by 50 basis points as of May 31, 2016, we estimate the change would have decreased the fair values of our marketable securities holdings by $282 million. Our floating-rate debt securities serve to lower the overall risk to our\\ninvestments portfolio associated with the risk of rising interest rates. Substantially all of our marketable securities are designated as available-for-sale. We generally do not use our investments for trading purposes. \\nChanges in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. For\\nfiscal 2016, total interest income was $538 million with our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities investments yielding an average 1.16% on a worldwide basis. The table below presents the approximate fair values of our cash, cash\\nequivalents and marketable securities and the related weighted-average interest rates for our investment portfolio at May 31, 2016 and 2015.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nMay 31,\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2016\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2015\\n\\xa0\\n\\n (Dollars in millions)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nFair Value\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nWeighted-AverageInterestRate\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nFair Value\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nWeighted-AverageInterestRate\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Cash and cash equivalents\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa020,152\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n0.35%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa021,716\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n0.36%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Marketable securities\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n35,973\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n1.62%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n32,652\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n1.07%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n56,125\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n1.16%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n54,368\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n0.79%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Interest Expense Risk  Interest Expense Risk\\x97Fixed to Variable Interest Rate Swap Agreements   Our total borrowings were $43.9 billion as of May 31, 2016, consisting of $37.8 billion of fixed-rate borrowings, $2.3 billion of floating-rate borrowings (Floating-Rate Notes) and $3.8 billion of\\nshort-term borrowings under a revolving credit agreement (Short-Term Borrowings). \\n \\xa0 77 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n We have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the\\nfixed-interest obligations associated with our $1.5 billion of 2.375% senior notes due January 2019 (January 2019 Notes), our $2.0 billion of 2.25% senior notes due October 2019 (October 2019 Notes), and our $1.5 billion of 2.80% senior notes due\\nJuly 2021 (July 2021 Notes) so that the interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. The critical terms of the interest rate swap agreements match the critical terms of the January 2019 Notes, October 2019\\nNotes, and July 2021 Notes that the interest rate swap agreements pertain to, including the notional amounts and maturity dates. We do not use these interest rate swap arrangements or our fixed-rate borrowings for trading purposes. We are accounting\\nfor these interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815). The total fair value gain of these fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements as of May 31, 2016 was $122 million. If\\nLIBOR-based interest rates would have been higher by 100 basis points as of May 31, 2016, the change would have decreased the fair values of the fixed to variable swap agreements by $185 million. Additional details regarding our senior notes and\\nrelated interest rate swap agreements are included in Notes 8 and 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.  By issuing the Floating-Rate Notes and the Short-Term Borrowings, and by entering into the aforementioned interest rate swap arrangements, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates\\nbased upon LIBOR. As of May 31, 2016, the weighted-average interest rate associated with our Floating-Rate Notes, Short-Term Borrowings and January 2019 Notes, October 2019 Notes and July 2021 Notes, after considering the effects of the\\naforementioned interest rate swap arrangements, was 1.14%. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations. An interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure\\ninterest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest rates. As of May 31, 2016, if LIBOR-based interest rates would have been higher by 100 basis points, the change would have increased\\nour interest expense annually by approximately $76 million as it relates to our fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements and floating-rate borrowings.  Currency Risk  Foreign Currency Transaction Risk\\x97Foreign Currency\\nForward Contracts  We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign\\ncurrency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign\\ncurrency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions. We may suspend this program from time to time. Our foreign\\ncurrency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees, intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. \\nNeither do we use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments\\npursuant to ASC 815. Accordingly, we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statement of operations. Given the short\\nduration of the forward contracts, amounts recorded generally are not significant. The balance sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is prepaid expenses and other current assets for forward contracts in an unrealized\\ngain position and other current liabilities for forward contracts in an unrealized loss position. The statement of operations classification for changes in fair values of these forward contracts is non-operating income (expense), net for both\\nrealized and unrealized gains and losses. \\n \\xa0 78 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n We expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures,\\nnet of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the\\ncurrency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors. As of May 31, 2016 and 2015, the notional amounts of the forward contracts\\nwe held to purchase U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $2.7 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. As of May 31, 2016 and 2015, the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell U.S. Dollars in exchange\\nfor other major international currencies were $2.0 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal at May 31, 2016 and 2015. Net foreign exchange transaction losses included\\nin non-operating income (expense), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $110 million, $157 million and $375 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Included in the net foreign exchange transaction losses\\nfor fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 were foreign currency remeasurement losses relating to our Venezuelan subsidiary\\x92s operations of $7 million, $23 million and $213 million, respectively (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nincluded elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information). As a large portion of our consolidated operations are international, we could experience additional foreign currency volatility in the future, the amounts and timing of which are\\nunknown.  Foreign Currency Translation Risk\\x97Impact on Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities \\nFluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of\\nthese amounts into U.S. Dollars. In particular, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by these subsidiaries is subject to translation variance caused\\nby changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and is also presented as a line\\nitem in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report).  As the U.S. Dollar fluctuated against\\ncertain international currencies as of the end of fiscal 2016, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for foreign subsidiaries that hold international currencies as of May 31, 2016 decreased\\nrelative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate as of May 31, 2015. As reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, the estimated effects of exchange rate changes on our reported cash and cash equivalents balances in\\nU.S. Dollars for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 were decreases of $115 million, $1.2 billion and $158 million, respectively. The following table includes estimates of the U.S. Dollar equivalent of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\\ndenominated in certain major foreign currencies that we held as of May 31, 2016:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n (in millions)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nU.S.\\xa0DollarEquivalent\\xa0atMay\\xa031,\\xa02016\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Euro\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n2,430\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Japanese Yen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n618\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Indian Rupee\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n493\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Chinese Renminbi\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n442\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Canadian Dollar\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n369\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n British Pound\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n262\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Swiss Franc\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n191\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Australian Dollar\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n184\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Other foreign currencies\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n1,806\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated in foreign currencies\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n6,795\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n If overall foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the U.S. Dollar uniformly would have been weaker by 10%, the\\namount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities we would report in U.S. Dollars would have decreased by approximately $680 million, assuming constant foreign currency cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances. \\n \\xa0 79 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Foreign Currency Translation Risk\\x97Net Investment Hedge  \\nIn July 2013, we issued \\x80750 million of 3.125% senior notes due July 2025 (July 2025 Notes). We designated the July 2025 Notes as a net investment\\nhedge of our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholders\\x92 equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro\\nwith respect to the U.S. Dollar. As a result, provided there is no ineffectiveness related to the hedge, the change in the carrying value of the Euro-denominated July 2025 Notes due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on the effective\\nportion is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report and totaled $25\\nmillion of net other comprehensive losses for fiscal 2016. Any remaining change in the carrying value of the July 2025 Notes representing any ineffective portion of the net investment hedge is recognized in non-operating income (expense), net. We\\ndid not record any ineffectiveness during fiscal 2016.  Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the Euro and the U.S. Dollar will impact the\\namount of U.S. Dollars that we will require to settle the July 2025 Notes at maturity. If the U.S. Dollar would have been weaker by 10% in comparison to the Euro as of May 31, 2016, we estimate our obligation to cash settle the principal portion of\\nthe July 2025 Notes in U.S. Dollars would have increased by approximately $84 million.

Item 9A.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Controls and Procedures \\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our Disclosure Committee and our management,\\nincluding our Principal Executive Officers (one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e).\\nDisclosure controls are procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, such as this Annual Report on Form 10-K, is recorded,\\nprocessed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Disclosure controls are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including\\nour Principal Executive Officers (one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer), as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our quarterly evaluation of disclosure controls includes an evaluation of some components of\\nour internal control over financial reporting. We also perform a separate annual evaluation of internal control over financial reporting for the purpose of providing the management report below. \\nThe evaluation of our disclosure controls included a review of their objectives and design, our implementation of the controls and the effect of the\\ncontrols on the information generated for use in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the course of the controls evaluation, we reviewed data errors or control problems identified and sought to confirm that appropriate corrective actions, including\\nprocess improvements, were being undertaken. This type of evaluation is performed on a quarterly basis so that the conclusions of management, including our Principal Executive Officers (one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer), concerning the\\neffectiveness of the disclosure controls can be reported in our periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K. Many of the components of our disclosure controls are also evaluated on an ongoing basis by both our internal audit and finance\\norganizations. The overall goals of these various evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and to modify them as necessary. We intend to maintain our disclosure controls as dynamic processes and procedures that we adjust as\\ncircumstances merit. \\n \\xa0 80 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Based on our management\\x92s evaluation (with the participation of our Principal Executive Officers, one\\nof whom is our Principal Financial Officer), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our Principal Executive Officers have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. \\nManagement\\x92s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting  Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the\\nsupervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive Officers (one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer), we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting\\nas of May 31, 2016 based on the guidelines established in Internal Control\\x97Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\\x92s 2013 framework. Our internal control over financial\\nreporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. \\nBased on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 31, 2016. We\\nreviewed the results of management\\x92s assessment with our Finance and Audit Committee.  The effectiveness of our internal control over\\nfinancial reporting as of May 31, 2016 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report. \\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during\\nour last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls  Our management, including our\\nPrincipal Executive Officers (one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer), believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their\\nobjectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control\\nsystem, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource\\nconstraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud,\\nif any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the\\nindividual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be\\nno assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may\\ndeteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item\\xa015(a) 2. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the\\nCompany\\x92s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.  We\\nconducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements\\nare free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates\\nmade by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Oracle Corporation at May 31, 2016 and 2015, and the\\nconsolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule,\\nwhen considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Oracle Corporation\\x92s internal control over financial reporting as of May 31,\\n2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated June 22, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\\n /s/ Ernst\\xa0& Young LLP  San Jose, California  June 22, 2016 \\n \\xa0 84 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \\nThe Board of Directors and Stockholders of Oracle Corporation  We have audited Oracle Corporation\\x92s internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control\\x97Integrated Framework issued by the Committee\\nof Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Oracle Corporation\\x92s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the\\neffectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management\\x92s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company\\x92s internal control over\\nfinancial reporting based on our audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight\\nBoard (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining\\nan understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such\\nother procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  A\\ncompany\\x92s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with\\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. A company\\x92s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and\\nthat receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized\\nacquisition, use, or disposition of the company\\x92s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its\\ninherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of\\nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  In our opinion, Oracle Corporation\\nmaintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2016, based on the COSO criteria.  We\\nalso have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Oracle Corporation as of May 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of\\noperations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2016 of Oracle Corporation and our report dated June 22, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \\n/s/ Ernst\\xa0& Young LLP \\nSan Jose, California  June\\xa022, 2016\\n\\n \\xa0 85 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n

Corporation develops, manufactures, markets, sells, hosts and supports application, platform and infrastructure technologies for information technology (IT) environments including database and\\nmiddleware software, application software, cloud infrastructure and hardware\\x97including Oracle Engineered Systems, computer server, storage, networking and industry-specific hardware products\\x97and related services that are engineered to work\\ntogether in cloud-based and on-premise IT environments. We offer our customers the option to deploy our comprehensive set of cloud services offerings including Oracle Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a\\nService (IaaS) or to purchase our software and hardware products and related services to manage their own cloud-based or on-premise IT environments. Customers that purchase our software products may elect to purchase software license updates and\\nproduct support contracts, which provide our customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period as well as technical support assistance. Customers that purchase our hardware\\nproducts may elect to purchase hardware support contracts, which provide customers with software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products, such as Oracle Solaris and certain other software\\nproducts, and can include product repairs, maintenance services, and technical support services. We also offer customers a broad set of services offerings that are designed to improve customer utilization of their investments in Oracle application,\\nplatform and infrastructure technologies including consulting services, advanced customer support services and education services.  Oracle\\nCorporation conducts business globally and was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun in June 1977.  Basis of Financial Statements  The consolidated financial statements included our accounts\\nand the accounts of our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. Noncontrolling interest positions of certain of our consolidated entities are reported as a separate component of consolidated equity from the equity attributable to Oracle\\x92s\\nstockholders for all periods presented. The noncontrolling interests in our net income were not significant to our consolidated results for the periods presented and therefore have been included as a component of non-operating income (expense), net\\nin our consolidated statements of operations. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Certain other prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Such reclassifications did not affect\\ntotal revenues, operating income or net income.  Included in acquisition related and other expenses as presented in our consolidated statements\\nof operations for fiscal 2016 and 2015 are an acquisition related benefit of $19 million and a litigation related benefit of $53 million, respectively. Further, acquisition related and other expenses for fiscal 2015 included $186 million related to\\na goodwill impairment loss (refer to Note 7 below for additional information).  In fiscal 2016, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU)\\n2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (ASU 2015-17) on a retrospective basis.\\xa0As required by ASU 2015-17, all deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current in our\\nconsolidated balance sheets, which is a change from our historical presentation whereby certain of our deferred tax assets and liabilities were classified as current and the remainder were classified as non-current. Upon adoption of ASU 2015-17,\\ncurrent deferred tax assets of $663 million and current deferred tax liabilities of $85 million in our May 31, 2015 consolidated balance sheet were reclassified as non-current and certain related reclassification entries were also recorded.\\n In addition, in fiscal 2016, we also adopted the following Accounting Standards Updates, none of which had a material impact to our reported\\nfinancial position or results of operations and cash flows:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n ASU 2016-07, Investments\\x97Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of\\nAccounting; \\n \\xa0 91 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2016  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n ASU 2016-06, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n ASU 2016-05, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships;\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n ASU 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n ASU 2015-15, Interest\\x97Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with\\nLine-of-Credit Arrangements\\x97Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory; and \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n ASU 2015-05,\\xa0Intangibles\\x97Goodwill and Other\\x97Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer\\x92s Accounting for Fees Paid in a\\nCloud Computing Arrangement.  Use of Estimates  Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board\\x92s (FASB) Accounting\\nStandards Codification (ASC), and we consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and\\nassumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and\\nassumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent that there are differences between\\nthese estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our consolidated financial statements will be affected. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require\\nmanagement\\x92s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management\\x92s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. \\nRevenue Recognition  Our sources of\\nrevenues include:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n cloud and on-premise software revenues, which include the sale of: new software licenses, which generally grant to customers a perpetual right to use\\nour database, middleware, applications and industry-specific software products; cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings, which grant customers access to a broad range of our software and related support offerings on a subscription basis in a secure,\\nstandards-based cloud computing environment; cloud IaaS offerings, which grant customers access to infrastructure cloud services to perform elastic compute, storage and networking services, and also provide management services for software and\\nhardware and related IT infrastructure, both generally on a subscription basis; and software license updates and product support offerings (described further below); \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n hardware revenues, which include the sale of hardware products including Oracle Engineered Systems, computer servers, storage products, networking and\\ndata center fabric products, and industry-specific hardware; and hardware support revenues (described further below); and  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n services revenues, which are earned from providing software and hardware related services including consulting, advanced customer support and education\\nservices.  Revenues generally are recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to\\ngovernmental authorities. \\n \\xa0 92 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2016  \\xa0\\n Revenue Recognition for Software Products and Software Related Services (Software Elements)\\n New software licenses revenues primarily represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database, middleware,\\napplication and industry-specific software products and exclude cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues and revenues derived from software license updates, which are included in software license updates and product support revenues. The basis for our new\\nsoftware licenses revenue recognition is substantially governed by the accounting guidance contained in ASC 985-605, Software-Revenue Recognition. We exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of\\nsoftware and software related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period.  For software license arrangements that do not\\nrequire significant modification or customization of the underlying software, we recognize new software licenses revenues when: (1) we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software; (2) we deliver the products;\\n(3) the sale price is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties; and (4) collection is probable. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met, are recognized\\nwhen those conditions are subsequently met.  Substantially all of our software license arrangements do not include acceptance provisions.\\nHowever, if acceptance provisions exist as part of public policy (for example, in agreements with government entities where acceptance periods are required by law, or within previously executed terms and conditions that are referenced in the current\\nagreement and are short-term in nature), we generally recognize revenues upon delivery provided the acceptance terms are perfunctory and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. If acceptance provisions are not perfunctory (for example,\\nacceptance provisions that are long-term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement), revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period. \\nThe vast majority of our software license arrangements include software license updates and product support contracts, which are entered into at the\\ncustomer\\x92s option, and the related fees are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement, typically one year. Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and\\npatches released during the term of the support period. Product support includes internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel. Software license updates and product support contracts\\nare generally priced as a percentage of the net new software licenses fees and are generally invoiced in full at the beginning of the support term. Substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts\\nannually.  Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements\\x97Software Products and Software Related Services (Software\\nArrangements)  We often enter into arrangements with customers that purchase both software related products and software related services\\nfrom us at the same time, or within close proximity of one another (referred to as software related multiple-element arrangements). Such software related multiple-element arrangements include the sale of our software products, software license\\nupdates and product support contracts and other software related services whereby software license delivery is followed by the subsequent or contemporaneous delivery of the other elements. For those software related multiple-element arrangements, we\\nhave applied the residual method to determine the amount of new software license revenues to be recognized pursuant to ASC 985-605. Under the residual method, if fair value exists for undelivered elements in a multiple-element arrangement, such fair\\nvalue of the undelivered elements is deferred with the remaining portion of the arrangement consideration generally recognized upon delivery of the software license. We allocate the fair value of each element of a software related multiple-element\\narrangement based upon its fair value as determined by our vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE\\x97described further below), with any remaining amount allocated to the software license. \\n \\xa0 93 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2016  \\xa0\\n Revenue Recognition for Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS Offerings, Hardware Products, Hardware Support\\nand Related Services (Non-software Elements)  Our revenue recognition policy for non-software deliverables including cloud SaaS, PaaS\\nand IaaS offerings, hardware products, support and related services is based upon the accounting guidance contained in ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition, Multiple-Element Arrangements, and we exercise judgment and use estimates in\\nconnection with the determination of the amount of cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues, hardware products revenues, support and related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period. \\nRevenues from the sales of our non-software elements are recognized when: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) we deliver the products\\nand passage of the title to the buyer occurs; (3) the sale price is fixed or determinable; and (4) collection is reasonably assured. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met are recognized\\nwhen those conditions are subsequently met. When applicable, we reduce revenues for estimated returns or certain other incentive programs where we have the ability to sufficiently estimate the effects of these items. Where an arrangement is subject\\nto acceptance criteria and the acceptance provisions are not perfunctory (for example, acceptance provisions that are long-term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement), revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt\\nof written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period.  Our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings generally provide customers access to\\ncertain of our software within a cloud-based IT environment that we manage, host and support and offer to customers on a subscription basis. Revenues for our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings are generally recognized ratably over the contract term\\ncommencing with the date the service is made available to customers and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied.  Our cloud\\nIaaS offerings provide infrastructure cloud services and also include deployment and management offerings for software and hardware and related IT infrastructure. Our cloud IaaS offerings are generally sold on a subscription basis and revenues for\\nthese cloud IaaS offerings are generally recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date the service is made available to customers and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. \\nRevenues from the sale of hardware products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of our Oracle Engineered Systems, computer servers, storage,\\nnetworking and industry-specific hardware and are recognized upon the delivery of the hardware product to the customer provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied.  Our hardware support offerings generally provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products and can also include product\\nrepairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees. Hardware support contracts are entered into at the customer\\x92s option and are\\nrecognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangements, which is typically one year, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied.  Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements\\x97Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS Offerings, Hardware Products, Hardware Support and Related Services (Non-software Arrangements) \\nWe enter into arrangements with customers that purchase non-software related products and services from us at the same time, or within close proximity of\\none another (referred to as non-software multiple-element arrangements). Each element within a non-software multiple-element arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting provided the following criteria are met: the delivered\\nproducts or services have value to the customer on a standalone basis; and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services, delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service is\\nconsidered probable and is substantially controlled by us. We consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by us or another vendor or could be resold by the customer. Further, our revenue\\n\\n \\xa0 94 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2016  \\xa0\\n \\narrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products. Where the aforementioned criteria for a separate unit of accounting are not met, the\\ndeliverable is combined with the undelivered element(s) and treated as a single unit of accounting for the purposes of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition. For those units of accounting that include more than one\\ndeliverable but are treated as a single unit of accounting, we generally recognize revenues over the contractual period of the arrangement, or in the case of our cloud offerings, we generally recognize revenues over the contractual term of the cloud\\nsoftware subscription. For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we allocate revenue to the respective revenue line items within our consolidated statements of operations based\\non a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of relative selling prices of such elements.  For our non-software\\nmultiple-element arrangements, we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangement\\x92s inception. The selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy: VSOE if available,\\nthird-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE are available (a description as to how we determine VSOE, TPE and ESP is provided below). If a tangible hardware product includes software,\\nwe determine whether the tangible hardware product and the software work together to deliver the product\\x92s essential functionality and, if so, the entire product is treated as a non-software deliverable. The total arrangement consideration is\\nallocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the non-software deliverables using the relative selling prices of each unit based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. We limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered\\nelements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional products or services or meeting of any specified performance conditions.  When possible, we establish VSOE of selling price for deliverables in software and non-software multiple-element arrangements using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and for\\nsoftware license updates and product support and hardware support, based on the renewal rates offered to customers. TPE is established by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with\\nsimilarly situated customers. If we are unable to determine the selling price because VSOE or TPE does not exist, we determine ESP for the purposes of allocating the arrangement by reviewing historical transactions, including transactions whereby\\nthe deliverable was sold on a standalone basis and considering several other external and internal factors including, but not limited to, pricing practices including discounting, margin objectives, competition, contractually stated prices, the\\ngeographies in which we offer our products and services, the type of customer (i.e., distributor, value-added reseller, government agency and direct end user, among others) and the stage of the product lifecycle. The determination of ESP is made\\nthrough consultation with and approval by our management, taking into consideration our pricing model and go-to-market strategy. As our, or our competitors\\x92, pricing and go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the\\nfuture, which could result in changes to our determination of VSOE, TPE and ESP. As a result, our future revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements could differ materially from our results in the current period. Selling prices are\\nanalyzed on an annual basis or more frequently if we experience significant changes in our selling prices.  Revenue Recognition Policies\\nApplicable to both Software and Non-software Elements  Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements\\x97Arrangements with\\nSoftware and Non-software Elements  We also enter into multiple-element arrangements that may include a combination of our various software\\nrelated and non-software related products and services offerings including new software licenses, software license updates and product support, cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, hardware products, hardware support, consulting, advanced customer\\nsupport services and education. In such arrangements, we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative selling prices of the software group of elements as a whole and\\n\\n \\xa0 95 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2016  \\xa0\\n \\nto the non-software elements. We then further allocate consideration within the software group to the respective elements within that group following the guidance in ASC 985-605 and our policies\\nas described above. After the arrangement consideration has been allocated to the elements, we account for each respective element in the arrangement as described above.  Other Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to Software and Non-software Elements  Many\\nof our software arrangements include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts and are included as a part of our services business. Consulting revenues from these arrangements are generally accounted\\nfor separately from new software licenses revenues because the arrangements qualify as services transactions as defined in ASC 985-605. The more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenues should be accounted for separately\\ninclude the nature of services (i.e., consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product), degree of risk, availability of services from other vendors, timing of payments and impact of milestones or\\nacceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee. Revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed. If there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment\\nfor the consulting services, revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved. We estimate the proportional performance on contracts with fixed or \\x93not to exceed\\x94 fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date\\nas a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project. If we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion, revenues are recognized when we receive final acceptance from the customer that the services have been\\ncompleted. When total cost estimates exceed revenues, we accrue for the estimated losses immediately using cost estimates that are based upon an average fully burdened daily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the services. The\\ncomplexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affects the amounts of revenues and related expenses reported in\\nour consolidated financial statements. A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes. \\nOur advanced customer support services are offered as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying other software and\\nnon-software products and services. We offer these advanced support services, both on-premise and remote, to Oracle customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their products and services. Depending upon the nature of the\\narrangement, revenues from these services are recognized as the services are performed or ratably over the term of the service period, which is generally one year or less.  Education revenues are also a part of our services business and include instructor-led, media-based and internet-based training in the use of our software and hardware products. Education revenues are\\nrecognized as the classes or other education offerings are delivered.  If an arrangement contains multiple elements and does not qualify for\\nseparate accounting for the product and service transactions, then new software licenses revenues and/or hardware products revenues, including the costs of hardware products, are generally recognized together with the services based on contract\\naccounting using either the percentage-of-completion or completed-contract method. For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we allocate revenues to software and non-software\\nelements based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of the relative selling price of such elements.  We also\\nevaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing \\x93fiscal funding\\x94 or \\x93termination for convenience\\x94 provisions, when such provisions are required by law, to determine the probability of possible cancellation. We\\nconsider multiple factors, including the history with the customer in similar transactions, the \\x93essential use\\x94 of the software or hardware products and the planning, budgeting and approval processes\\n\\n \\xa0 96 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2016  \\xa0\\n \\nundertaken by the governmental entity. If we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is remote, we then recognize revenues once all of the criteria\\ndescribed above have been met. If such a determination cannot be made, revenues are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity. \\nWe assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenues if all other revenue recognition requirements are met. Our\\nstandard payment terms are net 30 days. However, payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed. We evaluate non-standard payment terms based on whether we have successful collection history on comparable arrangements\\n(based upon similarity of customers, products, and license economics) and, if so, generally conclude such payment terms are fixed and determinable and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition. \\nWhile most of our arrangements for sales within our businesses include short-term payment terms, we have a standard practice of providing long-term\\nfinancing to creditworthy customers primarily through our financing division. Since fiscal 1989, when our financing division was formed, we have established a history of collection, without concessions, on these receivables with payment terms that\\ngenerally extend up to five years from the contract date. Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, we recognize new software licenses revenues and hardware products revenues for these arrangements upon delivery, net of any\\npayment discounts from financing transactions. We have generally sold receivables financed through our financing division on a non-recourse basis to third-party financing institutions within 90 days of the contracts\\x92 dates of execution and we\\nclassify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We account for the sales of these receivables as \\x93true sales\\x94 as defined in ASC 860, Transfers and\\nServicing, as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. We sold $1.8 billion of our financing receivables to financial institutions during each of fiscal 2016 and 2015, and $2.0 billion during fiscal 2014.\\n Our customers include several of our suppliers and, occasionally, we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendors at\\nor about the same time that we have sold our products to these same companies (Concurrent Transactions). Software license agreements, sales of hardware or sales of services that occur within a three-month time period from the date we have purchased\\ngoods or services from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure. When we acquire goods or services from a customer, we negotiate the purchase separately from any sales transaction, at terms we consider to\\nbe at arm\\x92s length and settle the purchase in cash. We recognize revenues from Concurrent Transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are met and the goods and services acquired are necessary for our current operations. \\nBusiness Combinations  We apply the\\nprovisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, in accounting for our acquisitions. It requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the\\nacquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets\\nacquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one\\nyear from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or\\nliabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. \\n \\xa0 97 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2016  \\xa0\\n Costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company or our internal operations are\\naccounted for as termination and exit costs pursuant to ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations, and are accounted for separately from the business combination. A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is\\nrecognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred. When estimating the fair value of facility restructuring activities, assumptions are applied regarding estimated\\nsub-lease payments to be received, which can differ materially from actual results. This may require us to revise our initial estimates which may materially affect our results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made.\\n For a given acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and\\nevaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities\\nassumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts.  If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a pre-acquisition contingency\\n(non-income tax related) by the end of the measurement period, which is generally the case given the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (1) it is probable that an asset existed\\nor a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and (2) the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent to the measurement period, changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could\\nhave a material effect on our results of operations and financial position.  In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation\\nallowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to\\nour preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance\\x92s or contingency\\x92s estimated value, whichever comes\\nfirst, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial\\nposition.  Marketable and Non-Marketable Securities  In accordance with ASC 320, Investments\\x97Debt and Equity Securities, and based on our intentions regarding these instruments, we classify substantially all of our marketable debt and\\nequity securities as available-for-sale. Marketable debt and equity securities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value, with all unrealized gains (losses) reflected net of tax in stockholders\\x92 equity on our consolidated\\nbalance sheets, and as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. If we determine that an investment has an other than temporary decline in fair value, we recognize the investment loss in non-operating income (expense), net\\nin the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. We periodically evaluate our investments to determine if impairment charges are required. Substantially all of our marketable debt and equity investments are classified as current based on\\nthe nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.  We hold investments in certain non-marketable equity\\nsecurities in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence. These equity securities are recorded at cost and included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. If based on the terms of our ownership of\\nthese non-marketable securities, we determine that we exercise significant influence on the entity to which these non-marketable securities relate, we apply the requirements of ASC 323, Investments\\x97Equity Method and Joint\\nVentures, to account for such investments. Our non-marketable securities are subject to periodic impairment reviews. \\nFair Values of Financial Instruments  We\\napply the provisions of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (ASC 820), to our assets and liabilities that we are required to measure at fair value pursuant to other accounting standards, including our investments in marketable debt and equity\\nsecurities and our derivative financial instruments.  The additional disclosures regarding our fair value measurements are included in Note 4.\\n\\n \\xa0 98 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2016  \\xa0\\n Allowances for Doubtful Accounts  We record allowances for doubtful accounts based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices. For those invoices not specifically reviewed, provisions are provided at differing rates,\\nbased upon the age of the receivable, the collection history associated with the geographic region that the receivable was recorded in and current economic trends. We write-off a receivable and charge it against its recorded allowance when we have\\nexhausted our collection efforts without success.  Concentrations of Risk  Financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivatives and trade receivables. Our cash and\\ncash equivalents are generally held with large, diverse financial institutions worldwide to reduce the amount of exposure to any single financial institution. Investment policies have been implemented that limit purchases of marketable debt\\nsecurities to investment-grade securities. Our derivative contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standings. We generally do not require collateral to secure accounts receivable. The risk with respect to trade\\nreceivables is mitigated by credit evaluations we perform on our customers, the short duration of our payment terms for the significant majority of our customer contracts and by the diversification of our customer base. No single customer accounted\\nfor 10% or more of our total revenues in fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014.  We outsource the design, manufacturing, assembly and delivery of certain\\nof our hardware products to a variety of companies, many of which are located outside the United States. Further, we have simplified our supply chain processes by reducing the number of third-party manufacturing partners and the number of locations\\nwhere these third-party manufacturers build our hardware products. Any inability of these third-party manufacturing partners to fulfill orders for our hardware products could adversely impact future operating results of our hardware business.\\n Inventories  Inventories are\\nstated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost, which approximates actual cost, on a first-in, first-out basis. We evaluate our ending inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence. This\\nevaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand within specific time horizons (generally six to nine months). Inventories in excess of future demand are written down and charged to hardware products expenses.\\nIn addition, we assess the impact of changing technology to our inventories and we write down inventories that are considered obsolete. At the point of loss recognition, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent\\nchanges in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.  Other Receivables\\n Other receivables represent value-added tax and sales tax receivables associated with the sale of our products and services to third\\nparties. Other receivables are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets and totaled $816 million and $817 million at May 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. \\nDeferred Sales Commissions  We defer\\nsales commission expenses associated with our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, and recognize the related expenses over the non-cancelable term of the related contracts, which are typically one to three years. Amortization of deferred sales\\ncommissions is included as a component of sales and marketing expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. \\n \\xa0 99 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2016  \\xa0\\n Property, Plant and Equipment  Property, plant and equipment are stated at the lower of cost or realizable value, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives\\nof the assets, which range from one to 40 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the lease terms, as appropriate. Property, plant and equipment are periodically reviewed for\\nimpairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We did not recognize any significant property impairment charges in fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014. \\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets and Impairment Assessments  Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Intangible assets that are not considered to have an\\nindefinite useful life are amortized over their useful lives, which generally range from one to 10 years. Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances\\nwarrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization.  The carrying amounts of our goodwill and intangible assets are periodically\\nreviewed for impairment (at least annually for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets) and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. According to ASC 350,\\nIntangibles\\x97 Goodwill and Other, we can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting unit\\x92s goodwill for impairment or we can directly perform the two-step impairment test. Based on our qualitative assessment,\\nif we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) to be less than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test will be performed. In the first step, we compare the fair\\nvalue of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing.\\nIf the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting\\nunit\\x92s goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit\\x92s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. We did not recognize any goodwill impairment charges in fiscal 2016 or\\n2014. During fiscal 2015, we recognized a $186 million goodwill impairment loss (refer to Note 7 below for additional information). \\nRecoverability of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the\\nasset is expected to generate. Recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured\\nas the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014.  Derivative Financial Instruments  During fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, we used derivative and\\nnon-derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency and interest rate risks (see Note 11 below for additional information). We account for these instruments in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815), which\\nrequires that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value as of the reporting date. ASC 815 also requires that changes in our derivatives\\x92 fair values be recognized in\\nearnings, unless specific hedge accounting and documentation criteria are met (i.e., the instruments are accounted for as hedges). \\n \\xa0 100\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2016  \\xa0\\n The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the\\nderivative and the resulting designation. For a derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change. The loss or gain attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized in\\nearnings with an offset recorded to the item for which the risk is being hedged. For a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge, each reporting period we record the change in fair value on the effective portion of the derivative to\\naccumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets, and an amount is reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings to offset the earnings impact that is attributable to the risk being hedged. For the\\nnon-derivative financial instrument designated as a net investment hedge for our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries, the change on account of remeasurement of the effective portion for each reporting period is recorded to\\naccumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets.  We perform the effectiveness testing of our aforementioned designated\\nhedges on a quarterly basis and the changes in ineffective portions of the derivatives, if any, are recognized immediately in earnings. \\nLegal Contingencies  We are currently\\ninvolved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. A description of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a\\nbusiness combination is provided under \\x93Business Combinations\\x94 above. For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination or related to income taxes, we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential\\nloss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Note 18 below provides additional information regarding certain of our legal contingencies. \\nShipping and Handling Costs  Our\\nshipping and handling costs for hardware products sales are included in hardware products expenses for all periods presented.  Foreign\\nCurrency  We transact business in various foreign currencies. In general, the functional currency of a foreign operation is the local\\ncountry\\x92s currency. Consequently, revenues and expenses of operations outside the United States are translated into U.S. Dollars using weighted-average exchange rates while assets and liabilities of operations outside the United States are\\ntranslated into U.S. Dollars using exchange rates at the balance sheet date. The effects of foreign currency translation adjustments are included in stockholders\\x92 equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying\\nconsolidated balance sheets and related periodic movements are summarized as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Net foreign exchange transaction losses included in non-operating income (expense), net in the\\naccompanying consolidated statements of operations were $110 million, $157 million and $375 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  Stock-Based Compensation  We account for share-based payments to employees, including\\ngrants of service-based restricted stock awards, performance-based restricted stock awards (PSUs), service-based employee stock options, and purchases under employee stock purchase plans, in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation\\x97Stock\\nCompensation, which requires that share-based payments (to the extent they are compensatory) be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values and the estimated number of shares we ultimately expect will vest.\\nFor our PSUs, we recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period for each separately vesting tranche, which is generally twelve months, as the performance conditions to evaluate attainment of each tranche\\nfor each participant are independent of the performance conditions for the other tranches. The amount of stock-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, recorded as of the end of \\n \\xa0 101\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2016  \\xa0\\n \\neach annual reporting period is based on the actual attainment of performance targets. During our interim reporting periods, stock-based compensation expense is recorded based on expected\\nattainment of performance targets. Changes in our estimates of the expected attainment of performance targets are reflected in the amount of stock-based compensation expense that we recognize for each PSU tranche on a cumulative basis during each\\ninterim reporting period in which such estimates are altered and may cause the amount of stock-based compensation expense that we record for each interim reporting period to vary. For our service-based awards, we recognize stock-based compensation\\nexpense, net of forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the service period of the award, which is generally four years.  We record deferred\\ntax assets for stock-based compensation awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns based on the amount of stock-based compensation recognized and the fair value attributable to the vested portion of stock awards assumed in connection\\nwith a business combination, at the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a tax deduction.  Advertising\\n All advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses, which were included within sales and marketing expenses, were $68\\nmillion, $55 million and $79 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  Research and Development and Software Development Costs\\n All research and development costs are expensed as incurred.  Software development costs required to be capitalized under ASC 985-20, Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased or Marketed, and under ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software, were not material to\\nour consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014.  Acquisition Related and Other Expenses \\nAcquisition related and other expenses consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, stock-based compensation expenses,\\nintegration related professional services, certain business combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended and certain other operating items, net.

Income Taxes  We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recorded for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets\\nand liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts recognized for income tax purposes. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized.\\n A two-step approach is applied pursuant to ASC 740 in the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken\\nin a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes.\\nThe second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our provision for income taxes line\\nof our consolidated statements of operations. A description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies and valuation\\nallowances assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under \\x93Business Combinations\\x94 above.  Recent Accounting\\nPronouncements  Financial Instruments:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial\\nInstruments\\x97Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (ASU 2016-13), which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held. ASU 2016-13 is effective for us in\\nour first quarter of fiscal 2021, and earlier adoption is permitted beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2016-13 on our consolidated financial statements. \\n \\xa0 103\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2016  \\xa0\\n In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments\\x97Overall (Subtopic 825-10):\\nRecognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (ASU 2016-01), which addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for us in our\\nfirst quarter of fiscal 2019, and earlier adoption is not permitted except for certain provisions. We currently do not expect that our pending adoption of ASU 2016-01 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. \\nStock-based Compensation:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation\\x97Stock Compensation (Topic\\n718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (ASU 2016-09). ASU 2016-09 changes how companies account for certain aspects of stock-based awards to employees, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory\\ntax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal\\xa02018, and earlier adoption is permitted. We believe we will early adopt ASU 2016-09 in the\\nfirst quarter of fiscal 2017 and are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption on our consolidated financial statements. We currently believe the most significant impact of our adoption of ASU 2016-09 to our consolidated financial\\nstatements will be to recognize certain tax benefits or tax shortfalls upon a restricted-stock award vesting or stock option exercise event relative to the deferred tax asset position established in our provision for income taxes line of our\\nconsolidated statement of operations instead of to consolidated equity.\\xa0During fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded $141 million, $267 million and $254 million to consolidated equity as tax benefits from our stock plans. \\nLeases:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02). ASU 2016-02 requires\\ncompanies to generally recognize on the balance sheet operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets. ASU 2016-02 is effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2020 on a modified retrospective basis, and earlier\\nadoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements, and we currently expect that most of our operating lease commitments will be subject to the new standard\\nand recognized as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets upon our adoption of ASU 2016-02, which will increase our total assets and total liabilities that we report relative to such amounts prior to adoption. \\nRevenue Recognition:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic\\n606 and issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance in August 2015, March 2016, April 2016 and May 2016 within ASU 2015-04, ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12, respectively (ASU 2014-09, ASU 2015-04, ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10 and\\nASU 2016-12 collectively, Topic 606).\\xa0Topic 606 supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. The core principle of Topic 606 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an\\namount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. Topic 606 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required\\nwithin the revenue recognition process than are required under existing GAAP, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the\\ntransaction price to each separate performance obligation, among others. Topic 606 is effective for us as of either our first quarter of fiscal 2018 or our first quarter of fiscal 2019 using either of two methods: (1) retrospective application of\\nTopic 606 to each prior reporting period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients as defined within Topic 606 or (2) retrospective application of Topic 606 with the cumulative effect of initially applying Topic 606 recognized\\nat the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures as defined per Topic 606.\\xa0Preliminarily, we plan to adopt Topic 606 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 pursuant to the aforementioned adoption method (1) and we do\\nnot believe there will be a material impact to our revenues upon adoption.\\xa0We are continuing to evaluate the impacts of our pending adoption of Topic 606 and our preliminary assessments are subject to change. \\n \\xa0 104\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2016  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\nACQUISITIONS  Fiscal 2017 Acquisitions\\n In June 2016, we acquired certain companies primarily to expand our cloud industry solutions offerings. These acquisitions were not\\nindividually significant. In the aggregate, the estimated total preliminary purchase price was $1.3 billion. An initial allocation of the purchase price for these acquisitions will be performed in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. \\nFiscal 2016 Acquisitions  During fiscal\\n2016, we acquired certain companies and purchased certain technology and development assets primarily to expand our products and services offerings. These acquisitions were not significant individually or in the aggregate. \\nFiscal 2015 Acquisitions \\nAcquisition of MICROS Systems, Inc. \\nOn June 22, 2014, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement) with MICROS Systems, Inc. (MICROS), a provider of integrated\\nsoftware, hardware and services solutions to the hospitality and retail industries. On July 3, 2014, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we commenced a tender offer to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of MICROS at a\\npurchase price of $68.00 per share, net to the holder in cash, without interest thereon, based upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. Between September 3, 2014 and September 8, 2014, pursuant to the terms of\\nthe tender offer, we accepted and paid for the substantial majority of outstanding shares of MICROS common stock. On September 8, 2014, we effectuated the merger of MICROS with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oracle pursuant to the terms of\\nthe Merger Agreement and applicable Maryland law, and MICROS became an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Oracle. Pursuant to the merger, shares of MICROS common stock that remained outstanding and were not acquired by us were converted into, and\\ncancelled in exchange for, the right to receive $68.00 per share in cash. The unvested equity awards to acquire MICROS common stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the conclusion of the merger were converted into equity awards denominated\\nin shares of Oracle common stock based on formulas contained in the Merger Agreement. We acquired MICROS to, among other things, expand our cloud and on-premise software, hardware and related services offerings for hotels, food and beverage\\nindustries, facilities, and retailers. We have included the financial results of MICROS in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.  Pursuant to our business combinations accounting policy, we estimated the fair values of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, and the excess of the consideration transferred over the aggregate of\\nsuch fair values was recorded as goodwill.

Other Fiscal 2015 Acquisitions  During fiscal 2015, we acquired certain other companies and purchased certain technology and development assets primarily to expand our products and services offerings. These acquisitions were not\\nindividually significant. We have included the financial results of the acquired companies in our consolidated financial statements from their respective acquisition dates, and the results from each of these companies were not individually material\\nto our consolidated financial statements. In the aggregate, the total purchase price for these acquisitions was approximately $1.7 billion, which consisted of approximately $1.7 billion in cash and $7 million for the fair values of restricted\\nstock-based awards and stock options assumed. We recorded $6 million of net tangible liabilities and $388 million of identifiable intangible assets, based on their estimated fair values, and $1.4 billion of residual goodwill. \\nFiscal 2014 Acquisitions \\nAcquisition of Responsys, Inc.  On\\nFebruary 6, 2014, we completed our acquisition of Responsys, Inc. (Responsys), a provider of enterprise-scale cloud-based business-to-consumer marketing software. We have included the financial results of Responsys in our consolidated financial\\nstatements from the date of acquisition. The total purchase price for Responsys was approximately $1.6 billion, which consisted of approximately $1.4 billion in cash and $147 million for the fair values of restricted stock-based awards and stock\\noptions assumed. We recorded $32 million of net tangible liabilities, related primarily to deferred tax liabilities, $580 million of identifiable intangible assets, and $14 million of in-process research and development, based on their estimated\\nfair values, and $1.0 billion of residual goodwill.  Other Fiscal 2014 Acquisitions \\nDuring fiscal 2014, we acquired certain other companies and purchased certain technology and development assets primarily to expand our products and\\nservices offerings. These acquisitions were not individually significant. We have included the financial results of these companies in our consolidated financial statements from their respective acquisition dates, and the results from each of these\\ncompanies were not individually material to our consolidated financial statements. In the aggregate, the total purchase price for these acquisitions was approximately $2.3 billion, which consisted primarily of cash consideration, and we recorded\\n$230 million of net tangible liabilities, related primarily to deferred tax liabilities, $1.1 billion of identifiable intangible assets, and $99 million of in-process research and development, based on their estimated fair values, and $1.3 billion\\nof residual goodwill.  Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information  The unaudited pro forma financial information in the table below summarizes the combined results of operations for Oracle, MICROS, and certain other companies that we acquired since the beginning of\\nfiscal 2015 that were considered relevant for the purposes of unaudited pro forma financial information disclosure as if the companies were combined as of the beginning of fiscal 2015. The unaudited pro forma financial information for all periods\\npresented also included the business combination accounting effects resulting from these acquisitions, including amortization charges from acquired intangible assets (certain of which are preliminary), stock-based compensation charges for restricted\\nstock-based awards and unvested stock options assumed, if any, and the related tax effects as though the aforementioned companies were combined as of the beginning of fiscal 2015.

Marketable securities consist of\\nTier-1 commercial paper debt securities, corporate debt securities and certain other securities.  The amortized principal amounts of our cash,\\ncash equivalents and marketable securities approximated their fair values at May 31, 2016 and 2015. We use the specific identification method to determine any realized gains or losses from the sale of our marketable securities classified as\\navailable-for-sale.

ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When\\ndetermining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at their fair values, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and consider assumptions that market participants would\\nuse when pricing the assets or liabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance.  ASC 820 establishes a\\nfair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. An asset\\x92s or a liability\\x92s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is\\nbased upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Level 1:\\xa0quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Level 2:\\xa0inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets\\nor liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or\\nliabilities; or  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Level 3:\\xa0unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair values of the assets or\\nliabilities.

We considered several approaches to determine the fair value of our hardware products reporting unit as of March 1, 2015 and concluded the most appropriate to be the income approach. The fair value of\\nour hardware products reporting unit pursuant to the income approach was impacted by lower forecasted operating results for this reporting unit, primarily caused by lower forecasted revenues and our continued investment in hardware products research\\nand development activities. We compared the implied fair value of goodwill in our hardware products reporting unit to its carrying value, which resulted in the $186 million goodwill impairment loss and represented the aggregate amount of goodwill\\nfor our hardware products reporting unit. The aggregate hardware products reporting unit goodwill that was impaired in fiscal 2015 resulted from our acquisitions of Pillar Data Systems, Inc., Xsigo Systems, Inc., GreenBytes, Inc. and MICROS Systems,\\nInc. Such impairment loss was recorded to acquisition related and other expenses in our fiscal 2015 consolidated statement of operations.

The effective interest rates after consideration of these fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements were 1.28% and 0.93% for the January 2019\\nNotes, 1.11% and 0.76% for the October 2019 Notes, and 1.26% and 0.91% for the July 2021 Notes as of May 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Refer to Notes 1 and 11 for a description of our accounting for fair value hedges.\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n(2)\\n In July 2013, we issued \\x802.0 billion of fixed-rate senior notes\\ncomprised of \\x801.25 billion of 2.25% senior notes due January 2021 (January 2021 Notes) and \\x80750 million of 3.125% senior notes due July 2025 (July 2025 Notes, and together with the January 2021 Notes, the Euro Notes). Principal and\\nunamortized discount/issuance costs for the Euro Notes in the table above were calculated using foreign currency exchange rates as of May 31, 2016 and May 31, 2015, respectively. The Euro Notes are registered and trade on the New York Stock\\nExchange. \\n \\xa0 111\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2016  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n(3)\\n In connection with the issuance of the January 2021 Notes, we entered\\ninto certain cross-currency swap agreements that have the economic effect of converting our fixed-rate, Euro-denominated debt, including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate, U.S. Dollar-denominated debt\\nof $1.6 billion with a fixed annual interest rate of 3.53% (see Note 11 for additional information).  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n(4)\\n We designated the July 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge of our\\ninvestments in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholders\\x92 equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect\\nto the U.S. Dollar (see Note 11 for additional information).  Senior Notes and Other Borrowings \\nIn January 2016, our $2.0 billion of 5.25% senior notes due January 2016 matured and were repaid. In July 2014, our $1.5 billion of 3.75% senior notes due\\nJuly 2014 (July 2014 Notes) matured and were repaid (we also settled the fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements associated with the July 2014 Notes).  Interest is payable semi-annually for the senior notes except for the Euro Notes for which interest is payable annually and the floating-rate senior notes for which interest is payable quarterly. We may\\nredeem some or all of the senior notes of each series prior to their maturity, subject to certain restrictions, and the payment of an applicable make-whole premium in certain instances except for the floating-rate senior notes which may not be\\nredeemed prior to their maturity.  The senior notes rank pari passu with any other notes we may issue in the future pursuant to our commercial\\npaper program (see additional discussion regarding our commercial paper program below) and all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness of Oracle Corporation. All existing and future liabilities of the subsidiaries of Oracle Corporation are\\nor will be effectively senior to the senior notes and any future issuances of commercial paper notes. We were in compliance with all debt-related covenants at May 31, 2016.  Future principal payments (adjusted for the effects of the cross-currency swap agreements associated with the January 2021 Notes) for all of our borrowings at May 31, 2016 were as follows (in millions):\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Fiscal 2017\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n3,750\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Fiscal 2018\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n6,000\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Fiscal 2019\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2,000\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Fiscal 2020\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n4,500\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Fiscal 2021\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2,655\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Thereafter\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n25,336\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Total\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa044,241\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n Revolving Credit Agreements  In May 2016, we entered into three revolving credit agreements with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as initial lender and administrative agent (the 2016 Credit Agreements) and borrowed $3.8 billion pursuant to\\nthese agreements. The 2016 Credit Agreements provided us with short-term borrowings for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Interest for the 2016 Credit Agreements is based on either (1) a LIBOR-based formula or (2) the Base Rate\\nformula, each as set forth in the 2016 Credit Agreements. The borrowings are due and payable on June 27, 2016, which is the termination date of the 2016 Credit Agreements.  In April 2013, we entered into a $3.0 billion Revolving Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Bank of America, N.A., BNP Paribas, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and certain other lenders (the 2013\\nCredit Agreement). The 2013 Credit Agreement provides for an unsecured 5-year revolving credit facility to be used for general corporate purposes including back-stopping any commercial paper notes that we may issue. Subject to certain conditions\\nstated in the 2013 Credit Agreement, we may borrow, prepay and re-borrow amounts under the 2013 Credit Agreement at any time during the term of the 2013 Credit Agreement. Interest under the 2013 Credit Agreement is based on either (a) a LIBOR-based\\nformula or (b) the Base Rate formula, each as set forth in the \\n \\xa0 112\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2016  \\xa0\\n \\n2013 Credit Agreement. Any amounts drawn pursuant to the 2013 Credit Agreement are due on April 20, 2018.\\xa0No amounts were outstanding pursuant to the 2013 Credit Agreement as of May 31, 2016\\nand 2015.  The 2016 Credit Agreements and the 2013 Credit Agreement contain certain customary representations and warranties, covenants and\\nevents of default. If any of the events of default occur and are not cured within applicable grace periods or waived, any unpaid amounts owed under the agreement to which the default relates may be declared immediately due and payable and the\\nrelevant agreement may be terminated. We were in compliance with the covenants of the 2016 Credit Agreements and the 2013 Credit Agreement as of May 31, 2016.  Commercial Paper Program and Commercial Paper Notes  In April 2013, pursuant to our\\nexisting $3.0 billion commercial paper program which allows us to issue and sell unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a private placement exemption from the registration requirements under federal and state securities laws, we entered\\ninto new dealer agreements with various banks and a new Issuing and Paying Agency Agreement with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (JP Morgan). Effective on December 22, 2014, Deutsche Bank Trust Companies Americas became the Successor Issuing and Paying\\nAgent replacing JP Morgan.\\xa0Since that time, we have entered into new dealer agreements with additional banks. As of May\\xa031, 2016 and 2015, we did not have any outstanding commercial paper notes. We intend to back-stop any commercial paper\\nnotes that we may issue in the future with the 2013 Credit Agreement.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n9.\\nRESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES  Fiscal 2015\\nOracle Restructuring Plan  During the second quarter of fiscal 2015, our management approved, committed to and initiated plans to\\nrestructure and further improve efficiencies in our operations due to our acquisition of MICROS and certain other operational activities (2015 Restructuring Plan). Restructuring costs associated with the 2015 Restructuring Plan were recorded to the\\nrestructuring expense line item within our consolidated statements of operations as they were incurred. We recorded $462 million and $100 million of restructuring expenses in connection with the 2015 Restructuring Plan in fiscal 2016 and 2015,\\nrespectively.

updates and product support revenues and deferred hardware support revenues represent customer\\npayments made in advance for support contracts that are typically billed on a per annum basis in advance with corresponding revenues being recognized ratably over the support periods. Deferred cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues generally resulted\\nfrom customer payments made in advance for our cloud-based offerings that are recognized over the corresponding contractual term. Deferred services revenues include prepayments for our services business and revenues for these services are generally\\nrecognized as the services are performed. Deferred new software licenses revenues typically resulted from undelivered products or specified enhancements, customer-specific acceptance provisions, customer payments made in advance for time-based\\nlicense arrangements and software license transactions that cannot be separated from undelivered consulting or other services.  In connection\\nwith our acquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the cloud SaaS and PaaS, software license updates and product support, and hardware support obligations, among others, assumed from our acquired companies. We generally have estimated the\\nfair values of these obligations assumed using a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. The sum of the costs and operating\\nprofit approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume these acquired obligations. These aforementioned fair value adjustments recorded for obligations assumed from our acquisitions reduced the cloud SaaS\\nand PaaS, software license updates and product support and hardware support deferred revenues balances that we recorded as liabilities from these acquisitions and also reduced the resulting revenues that we recognized or will recognize over the\\nterms of the acquired obligations during the post-combination periods. \\n \\xa0 115\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2016  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n11.\\nDERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  Fair\\nValue Hedges\\x97Interest Rate Swap Agreements  In July 2014, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic\\neffect of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with our October 2019 Notes and July 2021 Notes so that the interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. In July 2013, we entered into certain\\ninterest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with our January 2019 Notes so that the interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. The\\ncritical terms of the interest rate swap agreements match the critical terms of the October 2019 Notes, July 2021 Notes and the January 2019 Notes that the interest rate swap agreements pertain to, including the notional amounts and maturity dates.\\n We have designated the aforementioned interest rate swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for them as fair\\nvalue hedges pursuant to ASC 815. These transactions are characterized as fair value hedges for financial accounting purposes because they protect us against changes in the fair values of certain of our fixed-rate borrowings due to benchmark\\ninterest rate movements. The changes in fair values of these interest rate swap agreements are recognized as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amounts included in other assets or other non-current\\nliabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of net gain (loss) attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amount included in notes\\npayable, non-current. The periodic interest settlements for the interest rate swap agreements for the October 2019 Notes, July 2021 Notes and the January 2019 Notes are recorded as interest expense and are included as a part of cash flows from\\noperating activities.  In July 2014, we settled the fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements associated with the July 2014\\nNotes.\\xa0We do not use any interest rate swap agreements for trading purposes.  Cash Flow Hedges\\x97Cross-Currency Swap Agreements\\n In connection with the issuance of our January 2021 Notes, we entered into certain cross-currency swap agreements to manage the related\\nforeign currency exchange risk by effectively converting the fixed-rate, Euro-denominated January 2021 Notes, including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to fixed-rate, U.S. Dollar-denominated debt. The economic\\neffect of the swap agreements was to eliminate the uncertainty of the cash flows in U.S. Dollars associated with the January 2021 Notes by fixing the principal amount of the January 2021 Notes at $1.6 billion with a fixed annual interest rate of\\n3.53%. We have designated these cross-currency swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for these as cash flow hedges pursuant to ASC 815. The critical terms of the cross-currency swap agreements correspond to the January\\n2021 Notes, including the annual interest payments being hedged, and the cross-currency swap agreements mature at the same time as the January 2021 Notes.  We used the hypothetical derivative method to measure the effectiveness of our cross-currency swap agreements. The fair values of these cross-currency swap agreements are recognized as other assets or\\nother non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The effective portions of the changes in fair values of these cross-currency swap agreements are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets,\\nand an amount is reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss into non-operating income (expense), net in the same period that the carrying value of the Euro-denominated January 2021 Notes is remeasured and the interest expense is\\nrecognized. The ineffective portion of the unrealized gains and losses on these cross-currency swaps, if any, is recorded immediately to non-operating income (expense), net. We evaluate the effectiveness of our cross-currency swap agreements on a\\nquarterly basis. We did not record any ineffectiveness for fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014. The cash flows related to the cross-currency swap agreements that \\n \\xa0 116\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2016  \\xa0\\n \\npertain to the periodic interest settlements are classified as operating activities and the cash flows that pertain to the principal balance are classified as financing activities. \\nWe do not use any cross-currency swap agreements for trading purposes.  Net Investment Hedge\\x97Foreign Currency Borrowings  In July 2013, we designated our July\\n2025 Notes as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholders\\x92 equity caused by the changes in foreign\\ncurrency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the U.S. Dollar.  We used the spot method to measure the effectiveness of our net\\ninvestment hedge. Under this method, for each reporting period, the change in the carrying value of the Euro-denominated July 2025 Notes due to remeasurement of the effective portion is reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our\\nconsolidated balance sheet and the remaining change in the carrying value of the ineffective portion, if any, is recognized in non-operating income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations. We evaluate the effectiveness of our net\\ninvestment hedge at the beginning of every quarter. We did not record any ineffectiveness for fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014.  Foreign Currency\\nForward Contracts Not Designated as Hedges  We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that\\nprimarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or\\ndecreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions. We may suspend this program from\\ntime to time. Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees, intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions that are generally expected to be cash settled in the near term. Our foreign currency forward\\ncontracts are generally short-term in duration. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency exposures that we enter into, the currency exchange rates\\nassociated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized and unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors.  Neither do we use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815. Accordingly, we recorded the fair\\nvalues of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statement of operations. The balance sheet classification for the fair values of these forward\\ncontracts is prepaid expenses and other current assets for forward contracts in an unrealized gain position and other current liabilities for forward contracts in an unrealized loss position. The statement of operations classification for changes in\\nfair values of these forward contracts is non-operating income (expense), net, for both realized and unrealized gains and losses.  As of May\\n31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, the notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $2.7 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, and the notional amounts of\\nforward contracts we held to sell U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $2.0 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal at May 31, 2016\\nand 2015.  Included in our non-operating income (expense), net were $97 million, $60 million and $(69) million of net gains (losses) related to\\nthese forward contracts for the years ended May 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The cash flows related to these foreign currency contracts are classified as operating activities. \\n \\xa0 117\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2016  \\xa0\\n The effects of derivative and non-derivative instruments designated as hedges on certain of our\\nconsolidated financial statements were as follows as of or for each of the respective periods presented below (amounts presented exclude any income tax effects):  Fair Values of Derivative and Non-Derivative Instruments Designated as Hedges in Consolidated Balance Sheets  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nFair\\xa0Value\\xa0as\\xa0of\\xa0May\\xa031,\\n\\xa0\\n\\n (in millions)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n Balance\\xa0Sheet\\xa0Location\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02016\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02015\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nOther assets\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n122\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n74\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Cross-currency swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n Other\\xa0non-current\\xa0liabilities\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n(218\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n(244\\n)\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Foreign currency borrowings designated as net investment hedge\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n Notes\\xa0payable,\\xa0non-current\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n(991\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n(981\\n)\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n Effects of Derivative and Non-Derivative Instruments Designated as Hedges on Income and Other Comprehensive Income\\n(OCI) or Loss (OCL)  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nAmount\\xa0of\\xa0Gain\\xa0(Loss)\\xa0Recognized\\xa0inAccumulated\\xa0OCI\\xa0or\\xa0OCL\\xa0\\n(Effective\\xa0Portion)\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\nLocation\\xa0and\\xa0Amount\\xa0of\\xa0Gain\\xa0(Loss)\\xa0Reclassified\\xa0fromAccumulated\\xa0OCI\\xa0or\\xa0OCL\\xa0\\ninto\\xa0Income\\xa0(Effective\\xa0Portion)\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nYear\\xa0Ended\\xa0May\\xa031,\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nYear\\xa0Ended\\xa0May\\xa031,\\n\\xa0\\n\\n (in millions)\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02016\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02015\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02016\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02015\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Cross-currency swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n26\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n(318\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n Non-operating\\xa0income (expense),\\xa0net\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n41\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n(348\\n)\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Foreign currency borrowings designated as net investment hedge\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n(25\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n208\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nNot applicable\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\x97\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\x97\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nLocation\\xa0and\\xa0Amount\\xa0of\\xa0GainRecognized\\xa0in\\xa0Income\\xa0on\\xa0\\nDerivative\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nLocation\\xa0and\\xa0Amount\\xa0of\\xa0Loss\\xa0on\\xa0Hedged\\xa0ItemRecognized\\xa0in\\xa0\\nIncome\\xa0Attributable\\xa0to\\xa0Risk\\xa0Being\\xa0Hedged\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nYear Ended May 31,\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0Year\\xa0Ended\\xa0May\\xa031,\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n (in millions)\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02016\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02015\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2016\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2015\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges\\n\\xa0\\nInterest\\xa0expense\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n48\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n51\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nInterest\\xa0expense\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n(48\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n(51\\n)\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n12.\\nCOMMITMENTS AND CERTAIN CONTINGENCIES \\nLease Commitments  We lease certain\\nfacilities, furniture and equipment under operating leases.

We have approximately $54 million in facility obligations, net of estimated sublease income and other costs, in accrued restructuring for these locations in our\\nconsolidated balance sheet at May 31, 2016.  Rent expense was $283 million, $290 million and $278 million for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014,\\nrespectively, net of sublease income of approximately $45 million for each of fiscal 2016 and 2015, and $55 million for fiscal 2014. Certain lease agreements contain renewal options providing for extensions of the lease terms. \\nUnconditional Obligations  In the\\nordinary course of business, we enter into certain unconditional purchase obligations with our suppliers, which are agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and specify terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed,\\nminimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payment. We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for our hardware products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished hardware\\nproducts. We also obtain individual components for our hardware products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and\\ntypically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead-times and/or commercially standard lead-times for the particular part or product and have been included in the amounts below. Routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not\\nrelated to our external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in the ordinary course of business are not included in the amounts below, as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated\\nterms and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way.

To date, we have not incurred any material costs as a\\nresult of such indemnifications and have not accrued any material liabilities related to such obligations in our consolidated financial statements. Certain of our product sales agreements also include provisions indemnifying customers against\\nliabilities in the event we breach confidentiality or service level requirements. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to our limited and infrequent history of prior indemnification\\nclaims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.  Our software license and hardware products agreements\\nalso generally include a warranty that our products will substantially operate as described in the applicable program documentation for a period of one year after delivery.

As of May 31, 2016, approximately $8.8 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase\\nprogram.

Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace\\nof our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic and market\\nconditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time. \\nDividends on Common Stock  During fiscal\\n2016, 2015 and 2014, our Board of Directors declared cash dividends of $0.60, $0.51 and $0.48 per share of our outstanding common stock, respectively, which we paid during the same period.  In June 2016, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share of our outstanding common stock. The dividend is payable on July 27, 2016 to stockholders of record as of the\\nclose of business on July 6, 2016. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.

In fiscal 2011, our\\nstockholders, upon the recommendation of our Board of Directors (the Board), approved the adoption of the Amended and Restated 2000 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the 2000 Plan), which extended the termination date of the 2000 Plan by 10 years and\\nincreased the number of authorized shares of stock that may be issued by 388,313,015 shares. In fiscal 2014, our stockholders, upon the recommendation of our Board, approved a further increase in the number of authorized shares of stock that may be\\nissued under the 2000 Plan by 305,000,000 shares. Under the terms of the 2000 Plan, long-term full value awards are granted in the form of restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance stock units (PSUs). The vesting schedule for RSUs is established\\nby the Compensation Committee and generally requires vesting 25% annually over four years. The vesting schedule for PSUs is also established by the Compensation Committee and currently requires vesting over four fiscal years, if at all, based on\\nperformance. Options to purchase common stock are granted at not less than fair market value, become exercisable as established by the Compensation Committee of the Board (generally 25% annually over four years under our current practice) and\\ngenerally expire no more than 10 years from the date of grant. For each share granted as a full value award under the 2000 Plan, an equivalent of 2.5 shares is deducted from our pool of shares available for grant. As of May 31, 2016, the 2000 Plan\\nhad 47 million unvested RSUs outstanding, 4 million unvested PSUs outstanding and stock options to purchase 367 million shares of common stock outstanding of which 246 million shares were vested. As of May 31, 2016, approximately 317 million shares\\nof common stock were available for future awards under the 2000 Plan. To date, we have not issued any stock purchase rights or stock appreciation rights under the 2000 Plan.  In fiscal 1993, the Board adopted the 1993 Directors\\x92 Stock Plan (the Directors\\x92 Plan), which provides for the issuance of RSUs and other stock-based awards, including non-qualified stock\\noptions, to non-employee directors. The Directors\\x92 Plan has from time to time been amended and restated. Under the terms of the Directors\\x92 Plan, 10 million shares of common stock are reserved for issuance (including a fiscal 2013 amendment\\nto increase the number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance by 2 million shares). In prior years, we granted stock options at not less than fair market value, that vest over four years, and expire no more than 10 years from the date\\nof grant. The Directors\\x92 Plan was most recently amended on April 29, 2016 and permits the Compensation Committee of the Board to determine the amount and form of automatic grants of stock awards to each non-employee director upon first becoming\\na director and thereafter on an annual basis, as well as automatic nondiscretionary grants for chairing certain Board committees, subject to certain stockholder approved limitations set forth in the Directors\\x92 Plan. As of May 31, 2016,\\napproximately 147,000 unvested RSUs and stock options to purchase approximately 3 million shares of common stock (of which approximately 2 million were vested) were outstanding under the Directors\\x92 Plan. As of May 31, 2016, approximately 1\\nmillion shares were available for future stock awards under this plan.  In connection with certain of our acquisitions, we assumed certain\\noutstanding restricted stock-based awards and stock options under each acquired company\\x92s respective stock plans. These restricted stock-based awards and stock options generally retain all of the rights, terms and conditions of the respective\\nplans under which they were originally granted. As of May 31, 2016, approximately 491,000 shares of restricted stock-based awards and stock options to purchase 5 million shares of common stock were outstanding under these plans. \\n \\xa0 121\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2016  \\xa0\\n Restricted stock-based award activity and the number of restricted stock-based awards outstanding were\\nnot significant prior to fiscal 2015.

Approximately 7 million shares outstanding as of May 31, 2016 were not expected to vest. \\nStock-Based Compensation Expense and Valuation of Stock Awards  We estimated the fair values of our restricted stock-based awards that are solely subject to service-based vesting requirements based upon their intrinsic values as of the grant dates. \\nThe fair values of our PSUs were also measured based upon their intrinsic values as of their respective grant dates. The vesting conditions and related\\nterms of our PSUs were communicated to each participating employee as of their respective grant dates and included attainment metrics that were defined, fixed and based upon consistent U.S. GAAP metrics or internal metrics that are defined, fixed\\nand consistently determined, and that require the employee to render service. Therefore, these awards met the performance-based award classification criteria as defined within ASC 718.  We estimated the fair values of our stock options using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, which was developed for use in estimating the fair values of stock options. Option valuation models,\\nincluding the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, require the input of assumptions, including stock price volatility. Changes in the input assumptions can affect the fair value estimates and ultimately how much we recognize as stock-based\\ncompensation expense. The fair values of our stock options were estimated at the grant dates or at the acquisition dates for options assumed in a business combination.

The aggregate intrinsic value of vesting of restricted stock-based awards and options exercised was $1.0 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In connection with the vesting of restricted\\nstock-based awards and stock option exercises, the tax benefits realized by us were $311 million, $396 million and $480 million for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Of the total tax benefits received, we classified excess tax benefits from\\nstock-based compensation of $124 million, $244 million and $250 million as cash flows from financing activities rather than cash flows from operating activities for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. \\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan  We\\nhave an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (Purchase Plan) that allows employees to purchase shares of common stock at a price per share that is 95% of the fair market value of Oracle stock as of the end of the semi-annual option period. As of May 31,\\n2016, 54 million shares were reserved for future issuances under the Purchase Plan. We issued 3 million shares under the Purchase Plan in each of fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014.  Defined Contribution and Other Postretirement Plans  We offer various defined contribution\\nplans for our U.S. and non-U.S. employees. Total defined contribution plan expense was $387 million, $362 million and $357 million for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The number of plan participants in our benefit plans has generally\\nincreased in recent years as we have hired additional employees and assumed eligible employees from our acquisitions.  In the United States,\\nregular employees can participate in the Oracle Corporation 401(k) Savings and Investment Plan (Oracle 401(k) Plan). Participants can generally contribute up to 40% of their eligible compensation on a per-pay-period basis as defined by the Oracle\\n401(k) Plan document or by the section 402(g) limit as defined by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). We match a portion of employee contributions, currently 50% up to 6% of compensation each pay period, subject to maximum aggregate matching\\namounts. Our contributions to the Oracle 401(k) Plan, net of forfeitures, were $153 million, $144 million and $134 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. \\n \\xa0 124\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2016  \\xa0\\n We also offer non-qualified deferred compensation plans to certain employees whereby they may defer a\\nportion of their annual base and/or variable compensation until retirement or a date specified by the employee in accordance with the plans. Deferred compensation plan assets and liabilities were each approximately $419 million as of May 31, 2016\\nand were each approximately $408 million as of May 31, 2015 and were presented in other assets and other non-current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  We sponsor certain defined benefit pension plans that are offered primarily by certain of our foreign subsidiaries. Many of these plans were assumed through our acquisitions or are required by local\\nregulatory requirements. We may deposit funds for these plans with insurance companies, third-party trustees, or into government-managed accounts consistent with local regulatory requirements, as applicable. Our total defined benefit plan pension\\nexpenses were $95 million, $69 million and $64 million for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The aggregate projected benefit obligation and aggregate net liability (funded status) of our defined benefit plans as of May 31, 2016 was $949\\nmillion and $587 million, respectively, and as of May 31, 2015 was $1.0 billion and $599 million, respectively.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n15.\\nINCOME TAXES  The following is a\\ngeographical breakdown of income before the provision for income taxes:

States. At May 31, 2016, the amount of temporary differences related to undistributed earnings and other outside basis temporary differences of investments\\nin foreign subsidiaries upon which United States income taxes have not been provided was approximately $42.6 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. If these undistributed earnings were repatriated to the United States, or if the other outside basis\\ndifferences were recognized in a taxable transaction, they would generate foreign tax credits that would reduce the federal tax liability associated with the foreign dividend or the otherwise taxable transaction. At May 31, 2016, assuming a full\\nutilization of the foreign tax credits, the potential net deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences of undistributed earnings and other outside basis temporary differences would be approximately $13.3 billion and $2.7\\nbillion, respectively. \\n \\xa0 126\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2016  \\xa0\\n Our net deferred tax assets were $1.1 billion and $993 million as of May 31, 2016 and 2015,\\nrespectively. We believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generation of sufficient taxable income in future years\\nin appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in\\nfuture periods if estimates of future taxable income change.  The valuation allowance was $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion at May 31, 2016 and\\n2015, respectively. Substantially all of the valuation allowances as of May 31, 2016 and 2015 relate to tax assets established in purchase accounting. Any subsequent reduction of that portion of the valuation allowance and the recognition of the\\nassociated tax benefits associated with our acquisitions will be recorded to our provision for income taxes subsequent to our final determination of the valuation allowance or the conclusion of the measurement period (as defined above), whichever\\ncomes first.  At May 31, 2016, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $758 million. These losses expire in various\\nyears between fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2035 and are subject to limitations on their utilization. We had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $2.7 billion at May 31, 2016, which expire between fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2035 and are\\nsubject to limitations on their utilization. We had total foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1.6 billion at May 31, 2016, which are subject to limitations on their utilization. Approximately $1.4 billion of these foreign net\\noperating losses are not currently subject to expiration dates. The remainder of the foreign net operating losses, approximately $240 million, expire between fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2036. We had tax credit carryforwards of approximately $1.2 billion\\nat May 31, 2016, which are subject to limitations on their utilization. Approximately $652 million of these tax credit carryforwards are not currently subject to expiration dates. The remainder of the tax credit carryforwards, approximately $541\\nmillion, expire in various years between fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2035.  We classify our unrecognized tax benefits as either current or\\nnon-current income taxes payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The aggregate changes in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits, including acquisitions, were as follows: \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nYear Ended May 31,\\n\\xa0\\n\\n (in millions)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2016\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2015\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2014\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Gross unrecognized tax benefits as of June\\xa01\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n4,038\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n3,838\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n3,601\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Increases related to tax positions from prior fiscal years\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n350\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n119\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n94\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Decreases related to tax positions from prior fiscal years\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(111\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(17\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(116\\n)\\xa0\\n\\n Increases related to tax positions taken during current fiscal year\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n461\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n316\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n307\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Settlements with tax authorities\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(73\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(30\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(2\\n)\\xa0\\n\\n Lapses of statutes of limitation\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(73\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(54\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(53\\n)\\xa0\\n\\n Cumulative translation adjustments and other, net\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(31\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(134\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n7\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Total gross unrecognized tax benefits as of May\\xa031\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa04,561\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa04,038\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa03,838\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n As of May 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, $3.1 billion, $2.8 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, of unrecognized benefits\\nwould affect our effective tax rate if recognized. We recognized interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our provision for income taxes line of our consolidated statements of operations of $26 million, $102 million and $24\\nmillion during fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Interest and penalties accrued as of May 31, 2016 and 2015 were $765 million and $756 million, respectively.  Domestically, U.S. federal and state taxing authorities are currently examining income tax returns of Oracle and various acquired entities for years through fiscal 2015. Many issues are at an advanced\\nstage in the examination process, the most significant of which include the deductibility of certain royalty payments, transfer pricing, extraterritorial income exemptions, domestic production activity, foreign tax credits, and research and\\ndevelopment credits taken. Other issues are related to years with expiring statutes of limitation. With all of these \\n \\xa0 127\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2016  \\xa0\\n \\ndomestic audit issues considered in the aggregate, we believe it was reasonably possible that, as of May 31, 2016, the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to these audits could decrease\\n(whether by payment, release, or a combination of both) in the next 12 months by as much as $228 million ($176 million net of offsetting tax benefits). Our U.S. federal income tax returns have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2007 and we\\nare no longer subject to audit for those periods. Our U.S. state income tax returns, with some exceptions, have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2004 and we are no longer subject to audit for those periods. \\nInternationally, tax authorities for numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions are also examining returns affecting our unrecognized tax benefits. We believe it was\\nreasonably possible that, as of May 31, 2016, the gross unrecognized tax benefits, could decrease (whether by payment, release, or a combination of both) by as much as $199 million ($74 million net of offsetting tax benefits) in the next 12 months,\\nrelated primarily to transfer pricing. Other issues are related to years with expiring statutes of limitation. With some exceptions, we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations in non-U.S. jurisdictions for years prior to fiscal 1997.\\n We believe that we have adequately provided under GAAP for outcomes related to our tax audits. However, there can be no assurances as to the\\npossible outcomes or any related financial statement effect thereof. On July 27, 2015, in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion related to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany\\ncost-sharing arrangement. A final decision has yet to be issued by the U.S. Tax Court due to other outstanding issues related to the case. At this time, the U.S. Department of the Treasury has not withdrawn the requirement to include stock-based\\ncompensation from its regulations. We have reviewed this case and its impact on Oracle and concluded that no adjustment to the consolidated financial statements is appropriate at this time. We will continue to monitor ongoing developments and\\npotential impacts to our consolidated financial statements.  We are under audit by the IRS and various other domestic and foreign tax\\nauthorities with regards to income tax and indirect tax matters and are involved in various challenges and litigation in a number of countries, including, in particular, India, Brazil, and Korea, where the amounts under controversy are significant.\\nIn some, although not all, cases, we have reserved for potential adjustments to our provision for income taxes and accrual of indirect taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities or final\\noutcomes in judicial proceedings, and we believe that the final outcome of these examinations, agreements or judicial proceedings will not have a material effect on our results of operations. If events occur which indicate payment of these amounts\\nis unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in the recognition of benefits in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimates of the federal, state, and foreign income tax liabilities and indirect\\ntax liabilities are less than the ultimate assessment, it would result in a further charge to expense.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n16.\\nSEGMENT INFORMATION  ASC 280, Segment\\nReporting, establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief\\noperating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our chief operating decision makers are our Chief Executive Officers. We are organized geographically and by line of business.\\nWhile our Chief Executive Officers evaluate results in a number of different ways, the line of business management structure is the primary basis for which the allocation of resources and financial results are assessed. \\nWe have three businesses\\x97cloud and on-premise software, hardware and services\\x97which are further divided into certain operating segments. Our\\ncloud and on-premise software business is comprised of three operating segments: (1) cloud software and on-premise software, which includes our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings, (2) cloud IaaS and (3) software license updates and product support. Our\\nhardware business is comprised of two operating segments: (1) hardware products and (2) hardware support. All other operating segments are combined under our services business. \\n \\xa0 128\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2016  \\xa0\\n Our cloud software and on-premise software line of business markets, sells and delivers a broad spectrum\\nof application and platform technologies through our SaaS and PaaS offerings, which are certain of our software applications and platforms that are delivered via a cloud-based IT environment that we host, manage and support, and through the\\nlicensing of our software products including Oracle Applications, Oracle Database, Oracle Fusion Middleware and Java, among others.  The cloud\\nIaaS line of business provides infrastructure cloud services that are enterprise-grade, hosted and supported within the Oracle Cloud to perform elastic compute, storage and networking services on a subscription basis; and Oracle Managed Cloud\\nServices, which are comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services for customer IT infrastructure for a fee for a stated term that are hosted at our Oracle data center facilities, select partner data centers or physically\\non-premise at customer facilities.  The software license updates and product support line of business generates revenues through the sale of\\nsoftware support contracts related to new software licenses purchased by our customers. The software license updates and product support line of business provides our on-premise software customers with rights to software product upgrades and\\nmaintenance releases, patches released, internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel during the support period.  The hardware products line of business provides Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, networking, industry-specific hardware, virtualization software, operating systems including the Oracle Solaris\\nOperating System and management software to support diverse IT environments, including cloud computing environments.  Our hardware support line\\nof business provides customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products, such as Oracle Solaris and certain other software products, and can include product repairs,\\nmaintenance services and technical support services.  Our services business is comprised of the remainder of our operating segments and offers\\nconsulting, advanced customer support services and education services. Our consulting line of business primarily provides services to customers in business and IT strategy alignment, enterprise architecture planning and design, initial product\\nimplementation and integration and ongoing product enhancements and upgrades. Advanced customer support provides support services, both on-premise and remote, to our customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their products\\nand services and also includes certain other services. Education services provide training to customers, partners and employees as a part of our mission of accelerating the adoption and use of our cloud, on-premise software and hardware offerings.\\n We do not track our assets by operating segments. Consequently, it is not practical to show assets by operating segment. \\nThe following table presents summary results for each of our three businesses and for the operating segments of our cloud and

The original plaintiff, Hewlett Packard Company, is now Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company. The complaint alleged that when Oracle announced on March\\xa022 and 23, 2011 that it would no longer develop\\nfuture versions of its software to run on HP\\x92s Itanium-based servers, it breached a settlement agreement signed on September 20, 2010 between HP and Mark Hurd (the Hurd Settlement Agreement), who was both HP\\x92s former chief executive\\nofficer and chairman of HP\\x92s board of directors. HP sought a judicial declaration of the parties\\x92 rights and obligations under the Hurd Settlement Agreement, and other equitable and monetary relief. \\nOracle answered the complaint and filed a cross-complaint, which was amended on December 2, 2011. The amended cross-complaint alleged claims including\\nviolation of the Lanham Act. Oracle alleged that HP had secretly agreed to pay Intel to continue to develop and manufacture the Itanium microprocessor, and had misrepresented to customers that the Itanium microprocessor had a long roadmap, among\\nother claims. Oracle sought equitable rescission of the Hurd Settlement Agreement, and other equitable and monetary relief.  The court\\nbifurcated the trial and tried HP\\x92s causes of action for declaratory relief and promissory estoppel without a jury in June 2012. The court issued a final statement of decision on August 28, 2012, finding that the Hurd Settlement Agreement\\nrequired Oracle to continue to develop certain of its software products for use on HP\\x92s Itanium-based servers and to port such products at no cost to HP for as long as HP sells those servers. Oracle has announced that it is appealing this\\ndecision. The issues of breach, HP\\x92s performance, causation and damages, HP\\x92s tort claims, and Oracle\\x92s cross-claims will all be tried before a jury. As of April 8, 2013, the trial was stayed pending Oracle\\x92s appeal of the\\ncourt\\x92s denial of its anti-SLAPP motion. On August 27, 2015, the Court of Appeal affirmed the trial court\\x92s denial of Oracle\\x92s anti-SLAPP motion. The Court of Appeal\\x92s decision became final on September 26, 2015. The matter was\\nremanded to the trial court for further proceedings and trial, which began on May 23, 2016. While we believe that we have meritorious defenses against this action, and we will continue to vigorously defend it, we cannot currently estimate a\\nreasonably possible range of loss for this action due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the judicial process and the nature of the claims.  State of Oregon Litigation  On August 22, 2014, the Attorney General for the State of\\nOregon, the State of Oregon, and the Oregon Health Insurance Exchange Corporation, doing business as Cover Oregon (Cover Oregon), filed a lawsuit in the Circuit Court of the State of Oregon for the County of Marion against Oracle, our then-President\\nand Chief Financial Officer, three current and two former Oracle employees, and Mythics, Inc. The complaint alleges claims related to the work Oracle performed on Oregon\\x92s healthcare exchange website and Oregon\\x92s system for delivering\\nhealth and human services to low-income residents. Thereafter, Cover Oregon was dissolved, and the Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services (the DCBS) continued to assert Cover Oregon\\x92s claims. Also, one of the former Oracle\\nemployees was dismissed from the lawsuit. A First Amended Complaint was filed on August\\xa010, 2015.  The complaint alleges claims against\\nOracle for fraud, violations of Oregon\\x92s False Claims Act, breach of contract, and violations of the Oregon Civil Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, and alleges a violation of Oregon\\x92s False Claims Act against each of the\\nindividuals. The complaint seeks monetary damages, statutory penalties, attorneys\\x92 fees and costs, and a permanent injunction prohibiting Oracle from marketing to or entering into a contract with any public corporation or agency of the State of\\nOregon. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Oracle committed fraud by making false statements about the capabilities and functionality of its products and about the amount of time and effort it would take Oracle\\x92s consulting and managed\\ncloud services operations to perform the requested work. It also alleges that Oracle breached the contracts by failing to provide \\n \\xa0 133\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2016  \\xa0\\n \\nwhat was required under the contracts and failing to perform the services in a professional manner consistent with industry standards. The complaint alleges that Oracle violated Oregon\\x92s\\nFalse Claims Act by making false statements in order to obtain payment of invoices and by presenting invoices for payment that were false. The claims for violation of Oregon\\x92s Civil Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act allege that\\nOracle violated the statute by making false statements in writing about the capabilities of Oracle\\x92s products and the functionality and readiness of the healthcare exchange website, by using those false statements to obtain the signatures\\nnecessary to secure the contracts, execute documents, and enable payment, and by using the wires to transmit documents containing the allegedly false statements. On May 16, 2016, the State of Oregon filed a motion seeking to amend its complaint to\\nadd a demand for punitive damages against Oracle for the claims alleging fraud and violations of the Oregon Civil Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.  The claims against the individuals allege that one former employee violated Oregon\\x92s False Claims Act by making false statements that fraudulently induced the State of Oregon to enter into its\\ncontracts with Oracle, and that the other four employees violated the statute by making false statements in order to get invoices paid.  Oracle\\nresponded to the original complaint on December 2, 2014, and filed a response to the First Amended Complaint on August 20, 2015. Oracle denied all claims and allegations and filed counterclaims against the DCBS for breach of contract, quantum\\nmeruit (a claim requesting payment for the value of services provided), and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The court granted the State of Oregon\\x92s motion to dismiss Oracle\\x92s claims for breach of contract\\nand the breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. On October 26, 2015, Oracle filed its amended response to Plaintiffs\\x92 First Amended Complaint and alleged counterclaims against the DCBS for breach of contract, breach of\\nthe implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, breach of implied-in-fact contract, quantum meruit, and promissory estoppel (a claim seeking to enforce promises that Oracle relied upon in providing services). The State of Oregon filed a\\nmotion to dismiss all counterclaims except the causes of action for quantum meruit and promissory estoppel, and on February 5, 2016 the court granted that motion and dismissed with prejudice Oracle\\x92s claims for breach of contract, breach\\nof the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and breach of implied-in-fact contract. Oracle seeks monetary damages to compensate it for the value of unpaid services and its attorneys\\x92 fees and costs. Trial is set to begin on January\\n10, 2017. We cannot currently estimate a reasonably possible range of loss for this action. We believe that we have meritorious defenses against this action, and we will continue to vigorously defend it. \\nOn August 8, 2014, Oracle filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court, for the District of Oregon in Portland against Cover Oregon. The complaint alleged\\nclaims for breach of contract and quantum meruit and sought monetary damages to compensate Oracle for the value of unpaid services. On September 8, 2014, Oracle filed a First Amended Complaint adding two State of Oregon agencies as defendants\\nand adding causes of action for copyright infringement and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. On January 27, 2015, Oracle filed a Second Amended Complaint. Cover Oregon, now the DCBS, is a defendant as to all causes of\\naction; the other state agencies are defendants to the cause of action for copyright infringement. In addition to monetary damages, Oracle seeks an injunction prohibiting infringement of its copyrights. All defendants moved for judgment in their\\nfavor, claiming that the state entities have sovereign immunity (that is, they cannot be sued in federal court). On November 18, 2015, the court ruled on the motions, holding that two state agencies (Oregon Health Authority and Oregon Department of\\nHuman Services) do not have sovereign immunity, but that the DCBS does have sovereign immunity. On December\\xa09 and 17, 2015, Oracle and the Oregon parties each filed notices of appeal from that decision. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has\\ncoordinated the two matters, and briefing will begin in late April 2016.  On November 12, 2015, Oracle filed a lawsuit in the Circuit Court of\\nthe State of Oregon for the County of Marion against Oregon\\x92s Governor, Kate Brown, in her official capacity. Oracle filed a First Amended Complaint on January 15, 2016. In this lawsuit, Oracle alleges violations of Oregon\\x92s Public Records\\nLaw and seeks a court order declaring that Governor Brown has violated Oregon\\x92s Public Records Law and compelling compliance with that law. The Governor has moved to dismiss the complaint. \\n \\xa0 134\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2016  \\xa0\\n On January 21, 2016, Oracle filed a lawsuit in the Circuit Court of the State of Oregon for the County\\nof Marion against the State of Oregon, by and through Governor Kate Brown, Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum, and three state agencies. In this lawsuit, Oracle seeks to enforce an October 2015 oral agreement to resolve all pending litigation between\\nOracle and the State of Oregon. The State of Oregon moved to dismiss the complaint, and on April 28, 2016 that motion was denied. Oracle filed a First Amended Complaint on June 13, 2016, and Mythics, Inc. was added as a plaintiff. \\nOn March 8, 2016, Oracle filed a Complaint for a Writ of Mandamus in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against Sylvia Burwell,\\nSecretary, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, in her official capacity. In this lawsuit, Oracle alleges that, as to the State of Oregon and the Oregon Health Insurance Exchange, the Secretary failed to exercise her mandatory oversight\\nduties under the Affordable Care Act to monitor the integrity and performance of states and state health insurance exchanges that receive federal funds. Oracle seeks an order requiring the Secretary to exercise that mandatory duty and (1) direct the\\nState of Oregon to stay or dismiss its lawsuit against Oracle, and (2) monitor and investigate all work Oregon and its subgrantees and contractors, including Oracle, did on the health insurance exchange project to determine what liabilities\\ninvolving federal funds, if any, have arisen from it.  Other Litigation  We are party to various other legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, which arise in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings and claims that relate to acquisitions we\\nhave completed or to companies we have acquired or are attempting to acquire. While the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the outcome of any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will\\nresult in losses that are materially in excess of amounts already recognized, if any. \\n \\xa0 135\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n SCHEDULE II \\nORACLE CORPORATION  VALUATION AND QUALIFYING ACCOUNTS  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n (in millions)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nBeginningBalance\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nAdditionsCharged toOperations\\xa0orOther\\xa0Accounts\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nWrite-offs\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nTranslationAdjustmentsand Other\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nEndingBalance\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Allowances for Doubtful Trade Receivables\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Year Ended:\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n May 31, 2014\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n296\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n122\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n(120\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n8\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n306\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n May 31, 2015\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n306\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n56\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n(86\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n9\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n285\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n May 31, 2016\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n285\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n130\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n(90\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n2\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n327\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n \\xa0 136\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n SIGNATURES \\nPursuant to the requirements of Section\\xa013 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed\\non its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nORACLE CORPORATION\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDate: June 22, 2016\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBy:\\n\\xa0\\n /S/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0SAFRA A.\\nCATZ\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSafra A.

Our products include database and middleware software, application software, cloud infrastructure software and hardware systems (Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, networking and industry specific products), along with support and\\nrelated services. We offer over 400,000 worldwide customers a choice of deployment models to best suit their needs including (1)\\xa0the deployment of our products via our Oracle Cloud offerings, (2)\\xa0the acquisition of Oracle products and\\nservices for an on-premises IT environment or (3)\\xa0a mix of these two models.  For customers opting for a cloud computing model, Oracle\\noffers a wide range of services in all three primary layers of the cloud: Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Our Oracle Cloud offerings are designed to be: rapidly deployable to enable\\ncustomers shorter time to innovation; easily maintainable to reduce integration and testing work; and cost effective by requiring lower upfront customer investment. Our Oracle Cloud offerings integrate the software, hardware and services on the\\ncustomers\\x92 behalf in IT environments that we deploy, support and manage for the customer. We are a leader in the core technologies of cloud IT environments, including database and middleware software as well as enterprise applications,\\nvirtualization, clustering, large-scale systems management and related infrastructure. Our products and services are the building blocks of our Oracle Cloud services, our partners\\x92 cloud services and our customers\\x92 cloud IT environments.\\n In addition to offering a broad spectrum of cloud products and services, Oracle for decades has developed and sold its products and services\\nto our customers worldwide for use in their global data centers and on-premises IT environments. An important element of our corporate strategy is to continue our investments in, and innovation with respect to, our products and services that we\\noffer through our software and cloud, hardware and services businesses. In fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, we invested $5.5 billion, $5.2 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively, in research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of products\\nand services and to develop new products and services. We have a deep understanding as to how all components within IT environments\\x97application, platform and infrastructure\\x97interact and function with one another. We focus our development\\nefforts on improving the performance, operation and integration of these differing technologies to make them more cost-effective and easier to deploy, manage and maintain for our customers and to improve their computing performance relative to our\\ncompetitors. After purchasing Oracle products and services, customers can continue to take advantage of Oracle\\x92s research and development investments and deep IT expertise by purchasing and renewing Oracle support offerings, which may include\\nproduct enhancements that we periodically deliver to our Oracle E-Business Suite, Siebel, PeopleSoft and JD Edwards application software products, among others, or by renewing their SaaS, PaaS and IaaS contracts with us. \\nOracle customers are increasingly electing to run their IT environments using our suite of Oracle Cloud offerings. As customers deploy with the Oracle\\nCloud, many are adopting a hybrid IT model whereby certain of their IT resources are deployed and managed through the Oracle Cloud, while other of their IT resources are deployed and managed on-premises, and both sets of resources can be managed as\\none. We focus the engineering of our products and services to best connect these different deployment models to enable flexibility, ease, agility, compatibility, extensibility and seamlessness. \\nA selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. We believe our acquisitions enhance the products and\\nservices that we can offer to customers, expand our customer base, provide greater scale to accelerate innovation, contribute to our revenues and earnings, and increase stockholder value. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to\\nacquire a number of companies, products, services and technologies that add to, are complementary to, or have otherwise enhanced our existing offerings. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies to further our\\ncorporate strategy. \\n \\xa0 3 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n We have three businesses that deliver our application, platform and infrastructure technologies: software\\nand cloud, hardware systems, and services.

This design provides us with an ability to combine Oracle Solaris with our own hardware components to achieve certain performance\\nand efficiency advantages in comparison to our competitors. The Oracle Solaris operating system is based on the UNIX operating system, but is unique among UNIX systems in that it is available on our SPARC servers and x86 servers. We also support\\nOracle Solaris deployed on other companies\\x92 hardware products. \\n \\xa0 13 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n The Oracle Linux operating system with Oracle\\x92s Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel is a Linux operating\\nsystem for enterprise workloads including databases, middleware and applications. Oracle\\x92s Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel is designed to work well with Oracle products and enables users to patch core operating systems without downtime.\\n Oracle provides a broad portfolio of virtualization solutions from the desktop to the data center. Oracle VM is server virtualization software\\nfor both Oracle SPARC and x86 servers and supports both Oracle and non-Oracle applications. Oracle VM software is designed to enable different applications to share a single physical system for higher utilization and efficiency and simplify software\\ndeployment by enabling pre-configured software images to be created and rapidly deployed without installation or configuration errors. In addition, Oracle Solaris 11 provides comprehensive, built-in virtualization capabilities for both SPARC and x86\\nservers, networking and storage resources.  In addition to Oracle Solaris and Oracle Linux operating systems and Oracle\\x92s virtualization\\nsoftware, we also develop a range of other hardware-related software, including development tools, compilers, management tools for servers and storage, diagnostic tools and file systems.  Management Software  Oracle invests in a range of management technologies and\\nproducts in order to meet the needs of customers building and efficiently operating complex IT environments, including both end users\\x92 and service providers\\x92 cloud environments.\\xa0Oracle Enterprise Manager is a comprehensive management\\nsolution for all Oracle infrastructure, platform and applications technologies and provides an integrated view of the entire IT lifecycle including deployment, monitoring, and lifecycle management. Oracle Enterprise Manager can be applied to\\ntraditional on-premises, cloud, and hybrid cloud environments in a seamless manner via a single interface, which accelerates customer deployment of and transition to the cloud with Oracle products. Oracle also enhances and integrates with certain\\nkey open technologies including OpenStack, which is broadly supported by Oracle products for customers that require seamless integration with this method of cloud management and provisioning. The combination of Oracle\\x92s comprehensive solutions\\nand investments in open standards allows Oracle customers to manage Oracle products efficiently across a range of IT offerings from traditional on-premises environments to the most advanced cloud architectures. \\nHardware Systems Support  Our\\nhardware systems support offerings provide customers with software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products, such as Oracle Solaris and certain other software products, and can include product\\nrepairs, maintenance services and technical support services. We continue to evolve hardware systems support processes that are intended to proactively identify and solve quality issues and to increase the amount of new and renewed hardware systems\\nsupport contracts sold in connection with the sales of our hardware systems products. Hardware systems support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware systems products fees. \\nServices   We offer services solutions to help customers and partners maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle application, platform and infrastructure technologies. We believe our services are\\ndifferentiated based on our focus on Oracle technologies, extensive experience and broad sets of intellectual property and best practices. Our services business represented 9%, 10% and 11% of our total revenues in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013,\\nrespectively. Our services business, which is comprised of the remainder of our operating segments, offers the following:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n consulting services that are designed to help our customers and global system integrator partners more successfully architect and deploy our products,\\nincluding IT strategy alignment, enterprise architecture planning and design, initial product implementation and integration, and ongoing product enhancements and upgrades. We utilize a global, blended delivery model to optimize value for our\\ncustomers and partners, consisting of on-premises consultants from local geographies, industry specialists and consultants from our global delivery and solution centers; \\n \\xa0 14 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n advanced customer support services, which are provided on-premises and remotely to our customers to enable increased performance and higher\\navailability of their Oracle products and services; and  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n education services for Oracle products and services, including training and certification programs that are offered to customers, partners and\\nemployees through a variety of formats, including instructor led classes at our education centers, live virtual training, self-paced online training, private events and custom training. \\nMarketing and Sales  We directly market\\nand sell our products and services to businesses of many sizes and in many industries, government agencies and educational institutions. We also market and sell our products through indirect channels. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of\\nour total revenues in fiscal 2015, 2014 or 2013.  In the United States, our sales and services employees are based in our headquarters and in\\nfield offices throughout the country. Outside the United States, our international subsidiaries sell, support and service our products and offerings in their local countries as well as within other foreign countries where we do not operate through a\\ndirect sales subsidiary. Our geographic coverage allows us to draw on business and technical expertise from a global workforce, provides stability to our operations and revenue streams to offset geography specific economic trends and offers us an\\nopportunity to take advantage of new markets for our products. Our international operations subject us to certain risks, which are more fully described in \\x93Risk Factors\\x94 included in Item\\xa01A of this Annual Report. A summary of our\\ndomestic and international revenues and long-lived assets is set forth in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.  We also market our products worldwide through indirect channels. The companies that comprise our indirect channel network are members of the Oracle Partner Network. The Oracle Partner Network is a global\\nprogram that manages our business relationships with a large, broad-based network of companies, including independent software and hardware vendors, system integrators and resellers that deliver innovative solutions and services based upon our\\nproduct offerings. By offering our partners access to our product offerings, educational information, technical services, marketing and sales support, the Oracle Partner Network program extends our market reach by providing our partners with the\\nresources they need to be successful in delivering solutions to customers globally. The majority of our hardware systems products are sold through indirect channels including independent distributors and value added resellers. \\nSeasonality and Cyclicality  Our\\nquarterly revenues have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including the structure of our sales force incentive compensation plans, which are common in the technology industry. Our total revenues and operating margins are\\ntypically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fiscal quarter. The operating margins of our businesses are generally affected by seasonal factors in a similar manner as our revenues (in particular, our new software licenses\\nand cloud software subscriptions segment) as certain expenses within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short term. See \\x93Selected Quarterly Financial Data\\x94 in Item\\xa07 of this Annual Report for a more complete description of\\nthe seasonality and cyclicality of our revenues, expenses and margins.  Competition \\nWe face intense competition in all aspects of our business. The nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as\\nfirms emerge, expand or are acquired, as technology evolves and as customer demands and competitive pressures otherwise change.  Our customers\\nare demanding less complexity and lower total cost in the implementation, sourcing, integration and ongoing maintenance of their enterprise software and hardware systems. Our enterprise software and cloud and hardware offerings compete directly with\\nsome offerings from some of the largest and most competitive companies in the world, including Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft), International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), Intel, Hewlett-Packard Company (HP) and SAP AG and smaller companies\\nlike \\n \\xa0 15 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nsalesforce.com, inc. and Workday, Inc., as well as many others. In addition, due to the low barriers to entry in many of our market segments, new technologies and new and growing competitors\\nfrequently emerge to challenge our offerings. Our competitors range from companies offering broad IT solutions across many of our lines of business to vendors providing point solutions, or offerings focused on a specific functionality, product area\\nor industry. In addition, as we expand into new market segments, we will face increased competition as we will compete with existing competitors, as well as firms that may be partners in other areas of our business and other firms with whom we have\\nnot previously competed like Amazon.com, Inc. Moreover, we or our competitors may take certain strategic actions\\x97including acquisitions, partnerships and joint ventures, or repositioning of product lines\\x97which invite even greater\\ncompetition in one or more product categories.  Key competitive factors in each of the segments in which we currently compete and may compete\\nin the future include: total cost of ownership, performance, scalability, reliability, security, functionality, efficiency, ease of management and quality of technical support. Our product and service sales (and the relative strength of our products\\nand services versus those of our competitors) are also directly and indirectly affected by the following, among other things:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the adoption of cloud based IT offerings including software as a service, platform as a service and infrastructure as a service offerings;\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n total cost of ownership;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n ease of deployment, use and maintenance of our products and services offerings; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n compatibility between Oracle products and services deployed within on-premises IT environments and public cloud IT environments, including our Oracle\\nCloud environments;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the adoption of commodity servers and microprocessors; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the broader \\x93platform\\x94 competition between our industry standard Java technology platform and the .NET programming environment of Microsoft;\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n operating system competition among our Oracle Solaris and Linux operating systems, with alternatives including Microsoft\\x92s Windows Server, and\\nother UNIX and Linux operating systems;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the adoption of open source alternatives to commercial software by enterprise software customers; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n products, features and functionality developed internally by customers and their IT staff; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n products, features or functionality customized and implemented for customers by consultants, systems integrators or other third parties; and\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n attractiveness of offerings from business processing outsourcers.  For more information about the competitive risks we face, refer to Item\\xa01A. \\x93Risk Factors\\x94 included elsewhere in this Annual Report. \\nManufacturing  To produce our hardware\\nproducts, we rely on both our internal manufacturing operations as well as third party manufacturing partners. Our internal manufacturing operations consist primarily of materials procurement, assembly, testing and quality control of our Oracle\\nEngineered Systems and certain of our enterprise and data center servers, storage systems and networking products. For all other manufacturing, we generally rely on third party manufacturing partners to produce our hardware related components and\\nhardware products and we may involve our internal manufacturing operations in the final assembly, testing and quality control processes for these components and products. We distribute most of our hardware products either from our facilities or\\npartner facilities. Our manufacturing processes substantially are based on standardization of components across product types, centralization of assembly and distribution centers and a \\x93build-to-order\\x94 methodology in which products\\ngenerally are built only after customers have placed firm orders. Production of our hardware products requires that we purchase materials, supplies, product subassemblies and full assemblies from a number of vendors. For most of our hardware\\nproducts, we have existing alternate sources of supply or such sources are readily available. \\n \\xa0 16 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nHowever, we do rely on sole sources for certain of our hardware products. As a result, we continue to evaluate potential risks of disruption to our supply chain operations. Refer to \\x93Risk\\nFactors\\x94 included in Item\\xa01A within this Annual Report for additional discussion of the challenges we encounter with respect to the sources and availability of supplies for our products and the related risks to our business. \\nResearch and Development  We develop the\\nsubstantial majority of our products internally. In addition, we have extended our product offerings and intellectual property through acquisitions of businesses and technologies. We also purchase or license intellectual property rights in certain\\ncircumstances. Internal development allows us to maintain technical control over the design and development of our products. We have a number of United States and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our\\nproducts and technology. While we believe that our patents have value, no single patent is essential to us or to any of our principal business segments. Research and development expenditures were $5.5 billion, $5.2 billion and $4.9 billion in fiscal\\n2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, or 14% of total revenues in fiscal 2015 and 13% of total revenues in each of fiscal 2014 and 2013. Rapid technological advances in hardware and software development, evolving standards in computer hardware and\\nsoftware technology, changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements characterize the software and cloud and hardware markets in which we compete. We plan to continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to\\nresearch and development efforts to maintain and improve our current product and services offerings.  Employees \\nAs of May\\xa031, 2015, we employed approximately 132,000 full-time employees, including approximately 35,000 in sales and marketing, approximately\\n11,000 in software license updates and product support, approximately 6,000 in our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS operations, approximately 1,000 in the manufacturing of our hardware systems products, approximately 5,000 in hardware systems support,\\napproximately 23,000 in services, approximately 38,000 in research and development and approximately 13,000 in general and administrative positions. Of these employees, approximately 49,000 were employed in the United States and approximately 83,000\\nwere employed internationally. None of our employees in the United States is represented by a labor union; however, in certain foreign subsidiaries labor unions or workers\\x92 councils represent some of our employees. \\nAvailable Information  Our Annual Report\\non Form\\xa010-K, Quarterly Reports on Form\\xa010-Q, Current Reports on Form\\xa08-K and amendments to those reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are available, free of charge, on\\nour Investor Relations website at www.oracle.com/investor as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The following discussion, as well as our \\x93Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\x94 discussion in Management\\x92s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 7), highlights some of\\nthese risks. The risks described below are not exhaustive and you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our securities.  Economic, political and market conditions can adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability, which in turn could\\nadversely affect our stock price.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our business is influenced by a range of factors that are beyond our control and that we have no comparative advantage in forecasting. These include: \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n general economic and business conditions;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n overall demand for enterprise software, cloud offerings, hardware systems and services; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n governmental budgetary constraints or shifts in government spending priorities; and \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n general political developments.  Macroeconomic developments like the continued slow pace of economic recovery in Europe and parts of the United States, Asia and South America could negatively affect our business, operating results,\\nfinancial condition and outlook, which, in turn, could adversely affect our stock price. Any general weakening of, and related declining corporate confidence in, the global economy or the curtailment of government or corporate spending could cause\\ncurrent or potential customers to reduce or eliminate their information technology (IT) budgets and spending, which could cause customers to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services or cause customers not to pay us or to\\ndelay paying us for previously purchased products and services.  In addition, political unrest in places like Ukraine, Syria and Iraq and the\\nrelated potential impact on global stability, terrorist attacks and the potential for other hostilities in various parts of the world, potential public health crises and natural disasters continue to contribute to a climate of economic and political\\nuncertainty that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability. These factors generally have the strongest effect on our sales of new software licenses, hardware systems\\nproducts, hardware systems support and related services and, to a lesser extent, also may affect our renewal rates for software license updates and product support and our subscription-based cloud offerings. \\nWe may experience foreign currency gains and losses. Changes in currency exchange rates can adversely affect customer demand and our revenue and\\nprofitability.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We conduct a significant number of transactions and hold cash in currencies other than the U.S.\\xa0Dollar. Changes in the values of major foreign currencies, particularly the Euro, Japanese Yen and\\nBritish Pound, relative to the U.S.\\xa0Dollar can significantly affect our total assets, revenues, operating results and cash flows, which are reported in U.S. Dollars. In particular, the economic uncertainties relating to European sovereign and\\nother debt obligations may cause the value of the Euro to fluctuate relative to the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in foreign currency rates, most notably the recent strengthening of the U.S.\\xa0Dollar against the Euro, adversely affects our revenue\\ngrowth in terms of the amounts that we report in U.S. Dollars after converting our Euro-based results into U.S. Dollars and in terms of actual demand for our products and services as these products become relatively more expensive for Euro-based\\nenterprises to purchase. In addition, currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the United States. Generally, our revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the dollar\\nstrengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the dollar weakens. In addition, our reported assets generally are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies as a significant portion of our\\nconsolidated cash and bank deposits, among other assets, are held in foreign currencies. The U.S. dollar strengthened relative to other currencies, including the Euro, in fiscal 2015, which is reflected in our results. \\nCertain of our international subsidiaries operate in economies that have been designated as highly inflationary. We have incurred foreign currency losses\\nassociated with the devaluation of currencies in these highly inflationary economies relative to the U.S.\\xa0Dollar and we may continue to incur such losses in these countries or other emerging market countries where we do business. \\n \\xa0 19 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n In addition, we incur foreign currency transaction gains and losses, primarily related to sublicense fees\\nand other intercompany agreements among us and our subsidiaries that we expect to cash settle in the near term, which are charged against earnings in the period incurred. We have a program which primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts\\ndesigned to offset the risks associated with certain foreign currency exposures. We may suspend the program from time to time. As a part of this program, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign\\ncurrency exposures are offset at least in part by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in an effort to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transaction gains or losses. A large portion of our\\nconsolidated operations are international, and we expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts. For example, we will\\nexperience foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances if it is not possible or cost effective to hedge our foreign currency exposures, if our hedging efforts are ineffective, or should we suspend our foreign currency forward contract\\nprogram. Our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency exposures that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in\\nthose rates, whether we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors.\\xa0All of these factors could materially impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \\nWe may fail to achieve our financial forecasts due to inaccurate sales forecasts or other factors.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our revenues,\\nparticularly our new software licenses revenues and hardware systems revenues, are difficult to forecast. As a result, our quarterly operating results can fluctuate substantially.  We use a \\x93pipeline\\x94 system, a common industry practice, to forecast sales and trends in our business. Our sales personnel monitor the status of all proposals and estimate when a customer will\\nmake a purchase decision and the dollar amount of the sale. These estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline. Our pipeline estimates can prove to be unreliable both in a particular quarter and over a longer period of time, in\\npart because the \\x93conversion rate\\x94 or \\x93closure rate\\x94 of the pipeline into contracts can be very difficult to estimate. A reduction in the conversion rate, or in the pipeline itself, could cause us to plan or budget incorrectly\\nand adversely affect our business or results of operations. In particular, a slowdown in IT spending or economic conditions generally can unexpectedly reduce the conversion rate in particular periods as purchasing decisions are delayed, reduced in\\namount or cancelled. The conversion rate can also be affected by the tendency of some of our customers to wait until the end of a fiscal period in the hope of obtaining more favorable terms, which can also impede our ability to negotiate, execute\\nand deliver upon these contracts in a timely manner. In addition, for newly acquired companies, we have limited ability to predict how their pipelines will convert into sales or revenues for a number of quarters following the acquisition. Conversion\\nrates post-acquisition may be quite different from the acquired companies\\x92 historical conversion rates. Differences in conversion rates can also be affected by changes in business practices that we implement in our newly acquired companies.\\nThese changes may negatively affect customer behavior.  A substantial portion of our new software licenses and hardware systems contracts is\\ncompleted in the latter part of a quarter and a significant percentage of these are larger orders. Because a significant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the short-term, sales and revenue shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately\\nnegative impact on our profitability. The number of large new software licenses transactions and, to a lesser extent, hardware systems products transactions increases the risk of fluctuations in our quarterly results because a delay in even a small\\nnumber of these transactions could cause our quarterly sales, revenues and profitability to fall significantly short of our predictions. \\nOur Oracle Cloud strategy, including our Oracle Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and\\nData as a Service (DaaS) offerings, may adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We offer customers a full range of consumption models including the deployment of our products via our cloud based SaaS, PaaS,\\nIaaS and DaaS offerings. These business models continue to evolve, and we may not be able to compete effectively, generate significant revenues or maintain the profitability of our cloud offerings. Additionally, the increasing prevalence of cloud\\nand SaaS delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our on-premises enterprise software offerings and our cloud offerings, and has a dampening impact on overall demand for our on-premises software product\\nand service \\n \\xa0 20 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nofferings, which could reduce our revenues and profitability, at least in the near-term. If we do not successfully execute our cloud computing strategy or anticipate the cloud computing needs of\\nour customers, our reputation as a cloud services provider could be harmed and our revenues and profitability could decline.  Our cloud\\nofferings are generally purchased by customers on a subscription basis and revenues from these offerings are generally recognized ratably over the term of the subscriptions. The deferred revenue that results from sales of our cloud offerings may\\nprevent any deterioration in sales activity associated with our cloud offerings from becoming immediately observable in our consolidated statement of operations. This is in contrast to revenues associated with our new software licenses arrangements\\nwhereby new software licenses revenues are generally recognized in full at the time of delivery of the related software licenses. We incur certain expenses associated with the infrastructures and marketing of our cloud offerings in advance of our\\nability to recognize the revenues associated with these offerings. As customer demand for our cloud offerings increases, we experience volatility in our reported revenues and operating results due to the differences in timing of revenue recognition\\nbetween our new software licenses arrangements and cloud offering arrangements.  We have also acquired a number of cloud computing companies,\\nand the integration of these companies into our Oracle Cloud strategy may not be as efficient or scalable as anticipated, which could adversely affect our ability to fully realize the benefits anticipated from these acquisitions. \\nOur success depends upon our ability to develop new products and services, integrate acquired products and services and enhance our existing\\nproducts and services.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Rapid technological advances and evolving standards in computer hardware and software development and communications infrastructure, changing and increasingly sophisticated customer needs and\\nfrequent new product introductions and enhancements characterize the industries in which we compete. If we are unable to develop new or sufficiently differentiated products and services, enhance and improve our products and support services in a\\ntimely manner or position and price our products and services to meet demand, customers may not purchase or subscribe to our software, hardware or cloud offerings or renew software support, hardware support or cloud subscriptions contracts. Renewals\\nof these contracts are important to the growth of our business. In addition, we cannot provide any assurance that the standards on which we choose to develop new products will allow us to compete effectively for business opportunities in emerging\\nareas.  We have continued to refresh and release new offerings of our software and cloud and hardware products and services, including our\\nDatabase Multitenant, Database In-Memory, SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, DaaS and Oracle Engineered Systems offerings. Our business may be adversely affected if:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we do not continue to develop and release these or other new or enhanced products and services within the anticipated time frames;\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n there is a delay in market acceptance of a new, enhanced or acquired product line or service; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n there are changes in information technology trends that we do not adequately anticipate or address with our product development efforts;\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we do not timely optimize complementary product lines and services; or \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we fail to adequately integrate, support or enhance acquired product lines or services. \\nIf our security measures for our software, hardware, services or Oracle Cloud offerings are compromised and as a result, our data, our\\ncustomers\\x92 data or our IT systems are accessed improperly, made unavailable, or improperly modified, our products and services may be perceived as vulnerable, our brand and reputation could be damaged, the IT services we provide to our\\ncustomers could be disrupted, and customers may stop using our products and services, all of which could reduce our revenue and earnings, increase our expenses and expose us to legal claims and regulatory actions.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We\\nare in the information technology business, and our products and services, including our Oracle Cloud offerings, store, retrieve, manipulate and manage our customers\\x92 information and data, external data, as well as our own data. We have a\\nreputation for secure and reliable product offerings and related services and we have invested a great deal of time and resources in protecting the integrity and security of our products, services and the internal and external data that we manage.\\n\\n \\xa0 21 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n At times, we encounter attempts by third parties to identify and exploit product and service\\nvulnerabilities, penetrate or bypass our security measures, and gain unauthorized access to our or our customers\\x92, partners\\x92 and suppliers\\x92 software, hardware and cloud offerings, networks and systems, any of which could lead to the\\ncompromise of personal information or the confidential information or data of Oracle or our customers. Computer hackers and others may be able to develop and deploy IT related viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that could attack\\nour products and services, exploit potential security vulnerabilities of our products and services, create system disruptions and cause shutdowns or denials of service. This is also true for third party data, products or services incorporated into\\nour own. Data may also be accessed or modified improperly as a result of customer, partner, employee or supplier error or malfeasance and third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce customers, partners, employees or suppliers into disclosing\\nsensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our data, our customers\\x92, suppliers\\x92 or partners\\x92 data or the IT systems of Oracle, its customers, suppliers or partners. \\nHigh-profile security breaches at other companies have increased in recent years, and security industry experts and government officials have warned about\\nthe risks of hackers and cyber-attacks targeting information technology products and businesses. Although this is an industry-wide problem that affects other software and hardware companies, it affects Oracle in particular because computer hackers\\ntend to focus their efforts on the most prominent IT companies, and they may focus on Oracle because of our reputation for, and marketing efforts associated with, having secure products and services. These risks will increase as we continue to grow\\nour cloud offerings and store and process increasingly large amounts of data, including personal information and our customers\\x92 confidential information and data and other external data, and host or manage parts of our customers\\x92\\nbusinesses in cloud-based IT environments, especially in customer sectors involving particularly sensitive data such as health sciences, financial services and the government. We also have an active acquisition program and have acquired a number of\\ncompanies, products, services and technologies over the years. While we make significant efforts to address any IT security issues with respect to our acquired companies, we may still inherit such risks when we integrate these companies within\\nOracle.  If a cyber-attack or other security incident described above were to allow unauthorized access to or modification of our\\ncustomers\\x92 or suppliers\\x92 data, other external data or our own data or our IT systems or if the services we provide to our customers were disrupted, or if our products or services are perceived as having security vulnerabilities, we could\\nsuffer significant damage to our brand and reputation. Customers could lose confidence in the security and reliability of our products and services, including our cloud offerings, and perceive them to be not secure. This in turn could lead to fewer\\ncustomers using our products and services and result in reduced revenue and earnings. The costs we would incur to address and fix these security incidents would increase our expenses. These types of security incidents could also lead to lawsuits,\\nregulatory investigations and claims and increased legal liability, including in some cases contractual costs related to customer notification and fraud monitoring.  Our business practices with respect to the collection, use and management of personal information could give rise to liabilities or reputational harm as a result of governmental regulation, legal\\nrequirements or industry standards relating to consumer privacy and data protection.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0As regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase and worldwide laws and regulations concerning the handling of personal\\ninformation expand and become more complex, potential risks related to data collection and use within our business will intensify. U.S. and foreign governments have enacted or are considering enacting legislation or regulations, or may in the near\\nfuture interpret existing legislation or regulations, in a manner that could significantly impact the ability of Oracle and our customers and data partners to collect, augment, analyze, use, transfer and share personal and other information that is\\nintegral to certain services Oracle provides and data services. This could be true particularly in those jurisdictions where privacy laws or regulators take a broader view of how personal information is defined, therefore subjecting the handling of\\nsuch data to heightened restrictions that may be obstructive to the operations of Oracle and its customers and data providers. This impact may be acute in countries that have passed or are considering passing legislation that requires data to remain\\nlocalized \\x93in country\\x94, as this imposes financial costs on any service provider that is required to store data in jurisdictions not of its choosing and nonstandard operational processes that are difficult and costly to integrate with\\nglobal processes. Regulators globally are also imposing greater monetary fines for privacy violations, and the European \\n \\xa0 22 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nUnion (EU) is considering legislation that would impose fines for privacy violations based on a percentage of global revenues. Changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced\\nprotection of certain types of sensitive data, such as healthcare data or other personal information, could greatly increase our cost of providing our products and services or even prevent us from offering certain of our services in jurisdictions\\nthat we operate. Additionally, public perception and standards related to the privacy of personal information can shift rapidly, in ways that may affect Oracle\\x92s reputation or influence regulators to enact regulations and laws that may limit\\nOracle\\x92s ability to provide certain products. Any failure, or perceived failure, by Oracle to comply with U.S. federal, state, or foreign laws and regulations, including laws and regulations regulating privacy, data security, or consumer\\nprotection, or other policies, public perception, standards, self-regulatory requirements or legal obligations, could result in lost or restricted business, proceedings, actions or fines brought against us or levied by governmental entities or\\nothers, or could adversely affect our business and harm our reputation.  We might experience significant coding, manufacturing or\\nconfiguration errors in our software, hardware and cloud offerings.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Despite testing prior to their release and throughout the lifecycle of a product or service, software, hardware and cloud offerings sometimes contain\\ncoding or manufacturing errors that can impact their function, performance and security, and result in other negative consequences. The detection and correction of any errors in released software, hardware or cloud offerings can be time consuming\\nand costly. Errors in our software, hardware or cloud offerings could affect their ability to properly function or operate with other software, hardware or cloud offerings, could delay the development or release of new products or services or new\\nversions of products or services, could result in creating security vulnerabilities in our products or services, and could adversely affect market acceptance of our products or services. This includes third party software products or services\\nincorporated into our own. If we experience errors or delays in releasing our software, hardware or cloud offerings or new versions thereof, our sales could be affected and revenues could decline. In addition, we run Oracle\\x92s business\\noperations as well as cloud and other services that we offer to our customers on our products and networks. Therefore, any flaws could affect our ability to conduct our business operations and the operations of our customers. Enterprise customers\\nrely on our software and hardware products and services to run their businesses and errors in our software, hardware or cloud offerings could expose us to product liability, performance and warranty claims as well as significant harm to our brand\\nand reputation, which could impact our future sales.  If we are unable to compete effectively, the results of operations and prospects\\nfor our business could be harmed.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We face intense competition in all aspects of our business. The nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as firms emerge, expand or are\\nacquired, and as technology evolves. Many vendors develop and market databases, middleware products, application development tools, business applications, collaboration products and business intelligence products, among others, that compete with our\\nsoftware and cloud offerings. These vendors include on-premises software companies and companies that offer cloud based SaaS, PaaS, IaaS and DaaS offerings and business process outsourcing (BPO) as competitive alternatives to buying software and\\nhardware. Our competitors that offer business applications and middleware products may influence a customer\\x92s purchasing decision for the underlying database in an effort to persuade potential customers not to acquire our products. We could\\nlose customers if our competitors introduce new competitive products, add new functionality, acquire competitive products, reduce prices or form strategic alliances with other companies. We may also face increasing competition from open source\\nsoftware initiatives in which competitors may provide software and intellectual property for free. Existing or new competitors could gain sales opportunities or customers at our expense.  Our hardware systems business competes with, among others, (i)\\xa0systems manufacturers and resellers of systems based on our own microprocessors and operating systems and those of our competitors,\\n(ii)\\xa0microprocessor/chip manufacturers, (iii)\\xa0providers of storage products and (iv)\\xa0certain industry-specific hardware manufacturers including those serving communications, hospitality and retail industries. Our hardware systems\\nbusiness causes us to compete with certain companies that historically have been partners. Some of these competitors may have more experience than we do in managing a hardware business. A large portion of our hardware products are based on our SPARC\\nmicroprocessor and Oracle Solaris operating system platform, which has a smaller installed base than certain of our competitors\\x92 platforms and which may make it difficult for us to win new customers that have already made significant\\ninvestments in our competitors\\x92 platforms. Certain of these competitors also \\n \\xa0 23 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\ncompete very aggressively on price. A loss in our competitive position could result in lower revenues or profitability, which could adversely impact our ability to realize the revenue and\\nprofitability forecasts for our hardware systems business.  Our international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that\\ncan adversely affect our operating results.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from, and have significant operations, outside of the United States. Our international operations include software and\\nhardware systems development, manufacturing, assembly, sales, customer support, consulting and other services and shared administrative service centers.  Compliance with international and U.S.\\xa0laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations\\ninclude U.S.\\xa0laws and local laws which include data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, prohibitions on payments to governmental officials, import and trade restrictions and export requirements.\\nViolations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer\\nour products and services in one or more countries, could delay or prevent potential acquisitions and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our\\nbusiness and our operating results. Compliance with these laws requires a significant amount of management attention and effort, which may divert management\\x92s attention from running our business operations and could harm our ability to grow our\\nbusiness, or may increase our expenses as we engage specialized or other additional resources to assist us with our compliance efforts. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties. We monitor\\nour operations and investigate allegations of improprieties relating to transactions and the way in which such transactions are recorded. Where circumstances warrant, we provide information and report our findings to government authorities, but no\\nassurance can be given that action will not be taken by such authorities.  We are also subject to a variety of other risks and challenges in\\nmanaging an organization operating in various countries, including those related to:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n general economic conditions in each country or region; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n fluctuations in currency exchange rates and related impacts to customer demand and our operating results; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n difficulties in transferring funds from or converting currencies in certain countries such as Venezuela that have led to a devaluation of our net\\nassets, in particular our cash assets, in that country\\x92s currency;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n regulatory changes, including government austerity measures in certain countries that we may not be able to sufficiently plan for or avoid that may\\nunexpectedly impair bank deposits or other cash assets that we hold in these countries or that impose additional taxes that we may be required to pay in these countries; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n political unrest, terrorism and the potential for other hostilities, including those in Ukraine, Syria, Iraq and Yemen; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n natural disasters;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n overlapping tax regimes;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n our ability to repatriate funds held by our foreign subsidiaries to the United States at favorable tax rates; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n public health risks, particularly in areas in which we have significant operations; and \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.  The variety of risks and challenges listed above could also disrupt or otherwise negatively impact the supply chain operations for our hardware systems products segment and the sales of our products and\\nservices in affected countries or regions.  As the majority shareholder of Oracle Financial Services Software Limited (OFSS), a publicly traded\\ncompany in India, and Oracle Corporation Japan (NOKK), a publicly traded company in Japan, we are faced with several additional risks, including being subject to local securities regulations and being unable to exert full control that we would\\notherwise have if OFSS or NOKK were wholly owned subsidiaries. \\n \\xa0 24 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Acquisitions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were\\ncontemplated at the time of a transaction.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of companies, products, services and technologies. A selective and active acquisition program is an\\nimportant element of our overall corporate strategy and we expect to continue to make acquisitions in the future. Risks we may face in connection with our acquisition program include: \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n our ongoing business may be disrupted and our management\\x92s attention may be diverted by acquisition, transition or integration activities;\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may have difficulties (i)\\xa0managing an acquired company\\x92s technologies or lines of business; (ii)\\xa0entering new markets where we have\\nno or limited direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions; or (iii)\\xa0retaining key personnel from the acquired companies; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n an acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected, we may not integrate an acquired company or technology as successfully as we\\nexpected or we may overpay for, or otherwise not realize the expected return on, our investments, which could adversely affect our business or operating results and potentially cause impairment to assets that we recorded as a part of an acquisition\\nincluding intangible assets and goodwill;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n our operating results or financial condition may be adversely impacted by claims or liabilities that we assume from an acquired company or technology\\nor that are otherwise related to an acquisition, including, among others, claims from government agencies, terminated employees, current or former customers, former stockholders or other third parties; pre-existing contractual relationships of an\\nacquired company that we would not have otherwise entered into, the termination or modification of which may be costly or disruptive to our business; unfavorable revenue recognition or other accounting treatment as a result of an acquired\\ncompany\\x92s practices; and intellectual property claims or disputes;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may fail to identify or assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring a company or technology,\\nwhich could result in unexpected litigation or regulatory exposure, unfavorable accounting treatment, unexpected increases in taxes due, a loss of anticipated tax benefits or other adverse effects on our business, operating results or financial\\ncondition;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may not realize the anticipated increase in our revenues from an acquisition for a number of reasons, including if a larger than predicted number of\\ncustomers decline to renew software or hardware support contracts or cloud-based subscription contracts, if we are unable to sell the acquired products or service offerings to our customer base or if contract models of an acquired company do not\\nallow us to recognize revenues on a timely basis;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technologies, products, services and their related supply chain operations with our existing lines of\\nbusiness and supply chain infrastructure and maintaining uniform standards, architecture, controls, procedures and policies;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may have multiple product lines or services offerings as a result of our acquisitions that are offered, priced and supported differently, which\\ncould cause customer confusion and delays;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may have higher than anticipated costs in continuing support and development of acquired products or services, in general and administrative\\nfunctions that support new business models, or in compliance with associated regulations that are more complicated than we had anticipated;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may be unable to obtain timely approvals from, or may otherwise have certain limitations, restrictions, penalties or other sanctions imposed on us\\nby, worker councils or similar bodies under applicable employment laws as a result of an acquisition, which could adversely affect our integration plans in certain jurisdictions and potentially increase our integration and restructuring expenses;\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may be unable to obtain required approvals from governmental authorities under competition and antitrust laws on a timely basis, if at all, which\\ncould, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of an acquisition or have other adverse effects on our current business and operations;\\n\\n \\xa0 25 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n our use of cash to pay for acquisitions may limit other potential uses of our cash, including stock repurchases, dividend payments and retirement of\\noutstanding indebtedness;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition and we\\nmay have to delay or not proceed with a substantial acquisition if we cannot obtain the necessary funding to complete the acquisition in a timely manner or on favorable terms; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n to the extent that we issue a significant amount of equity securities in connection with future acquisitions, existing stockholders may be diluted and\\nearnings per share may decrease; and  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may experience additional or unexpected changes in how we are required to account for our acquisitions pursuant to U.S. generally accepted\\naccounting principles, including arrangements that we assume from an acquisition.  The occurrence of any of these risks could\\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or several concurrent acquisitions.  Our periodic workforce restructurings, including reorganizations of our sales force, can be disruptive.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We have in the past restructured or made other adjustments to\\nour workforce, including our direct sales force on which we rely heavily, in response to management changes, product changes, performance issues, acquisitions and other internal and external considerations. In the past, these types of sales force\\nrestructurings have resulted in increased restructuring costs, increased sales and marketing costs and temporary reduced productivity while the sales teams adjusted to their new roles and responsibilities. In addition, we may not achieve or sustain\\nthe expected growth or cost savings benefits of these restructurings, or do so within the expected timeframe. These effects could recur in connection with future acquisitions and other restructurings and our revenues and other results of operations\\ncould be negatively affected.  Our hardware systems revenues and profitability could decline if we do not manage the risks associated\\nwith our hardware systems business.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our hardware systems business may adversely affect our overall profitability if we do not effectively manage the associated risks. We may not achieve our estimated revenue, profit or\\nother financial projections with respect to our hardware systems business in a timely manner or at all due to a number of factors, including:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n as we develop and introduce new versions or next generations of our hardware systems products, customers may defer or delay purchases of existing\\nhardware systems products and wait for these new releases, all of which could adversely affect our hardware systems revenues in the short term;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n our hardware systems business has higher expenses as a percentage of revenues, and thus has been less profitable, than our software and cloud business;\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we have focused on our more profitable Oracle Engineered Systems, such as our Oracle Exadata Database Machine, Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud, Oracle\\nExalytics In-Memory Machine and Oracle SuperCluster products, which are in the relatively early stages of adoption by our customers, and the de-emphasis of our lower profit margin commodity hardware systems products could adversely affect our\\nhardware systems revenues because the lower profit systems have historically constituted a larger portion of our hardware systems revenues;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we face a greater risk of potential write-downs and impairments of inventory, higher warranty expenses than in our software and cloud and services\\nbusinesses, and amortization and potential impairment of intangible assets associated with our hardware systems business. Any of these items could result in material charges and adversely affect our operating results; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may not be able to increase sales of hardware systems support contracts or such increase may take longer than we anticipate, which could result in\\nlower revenues and profitability, or slower than expected growth of such revenues and profitability; and  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may acquire hardware companies that are strategically important to us but (i)\\xa0operate in hardware businesses with historically lower operating\\nmargins than our own; (ii)\\xa0have different legacy business \\n \\xa0 26 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n \\npractices and go-to-market strategies that we may alter as a part of our integration efforts, which may significantly impact our estimated revenues and profits from the acquired company;\\n(iii)\\xa0leverage different platforms or competing technologies that we may encounter difficulties in integrating; or (iv)\\xa0utilize unique manufacturing processes that affect our ability to scale these acquired products within our own\\nmanufacturing operations.  Our hardware systems offerings are complex products, and if we cannot successfully manage\\nthis complexity, the results of our hardware systems business will suffer.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Designing, developing, manufacturing and introducing new hardware systems products are complicated processes. The development process for our\\nhardware systems products is uncertain and requires a high level of innovation. After the development phase, we must be able to forecast customer demand and manufacture new hardware systems products in sufficient volumes to meet this demand and do\\nso in a cost effective manner. Our \\x93build-to-order\\x94 manufacturing model, in which our hardware systems products generally are not built until after customers place orders, may from time to time experience delays in delivering our hardware\\nsystems products to customers in a timely manner. These delays could cause our customers to purchase hardware products and services from our competitors. We must also manage new hardware product introductions and transitions to minimize the impact\\nof customer delayed purchases of existing hardware systems products in anticipation of new hardware systems product releases. It is also possible that we could experience design or manufacturing flaws which could delay or prevent the production of\\nthe components for which we have previously committed to pay or need to fulfill orders from customers and could also prevent the production of our hardware products or cause our hardware products to be returned, recalled or rejected resulting in\\nlost revenues, increases in warranty costs or costs related to remediation efforts, damage to our reputation, penalties and litigation.  We\\ndepend on suppliers to design, develop, manufacture and deliver on a timely basis the necessary technologies and components for our hardware products, and there are some technologies and components that can only be purchased from a single vendor due\\nto price, quality, technology, availability or other business constraints. As a result, our supply chain operations could be disrupted or negatively impacted by natural disasters, political unrest, port stoppages or other transportation disruptions\\nor slowdowns or other factors affecting the countries or regions where these single source component vendors are located or where the products are being shipped. We may be unable to purchase these items from the respective single vendors on\\nacceptable terms or may experience significant delays or quality issues in the delivery of necessary technologies, parts or components from a particular vendor. If we had to find a new supplier for these technologies, parts and components, hardware\\nsystems product shipments could be delayed, which would adversely affect our hardware systems revenues. We could also experience fluctuations in component prices which, if unanticipated, could negatively impact our hardware systems business cost\\nstructure. Additionally, we could experience changes in shipping and logistics of our hardware products, which could result in fluctuations in prices and negatively impact our hardware systems margins. These factors may make it difficult for us to\\nplan and procure appropriate component inventory levels in a timely fashion to meet customer demand for our hardware products. Therefore, we may experience component inventory shortages which may result in production delays or customers choosing to\\npurchase fewer hardware products from us or systems products from our competitors. We negotiate supply commitments with vendors early in the manufacturing process to ensure we have sufficient technologies and components for our hardware products to\\nmeet anticipated customer demand. We must also manage our levels of older component inventories used in our hardware products to minimize inventory write-offs or write-downs. If we have excess inventory, it may be necessary to write-down the\\ninventory, which would adversely affect our operating results. If one or more of the risks described above occurs, our hardware systems business and related operating results could be materially and adversely affected. \\nWe are susceptible to third party manufacturing and logistics delays, which could result in the loss of sales and\\ncustomers.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We outsource the design, manufacturing, assembly and delivery of certain of our hardware products to a variety of companies, many of which are located outside the United States. Our reliance on these third\\nparties reduces our control over the design, manufacturing and delivery process, exposing us to risks, including reduced control over quality assurance, product costs, product supply and delivery delays as well as the political and economic\\nuncertainties and natural disasters of the international locations where certain of these third party manufacturers have facilities and operations. Some countries may raise national security concerns or\\n\\n \\xa0 27 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nimpose market access restrictions based on location of manufacture or sourcing. Any manufacturing disruption or logistics delays by these third parties could impair our ability to fulfill orders\\nfor these hardware systems products for extended periods of time. If we are unable to manage our relationships with these third parties effectively, or if these third parties experience delays, disruptions, capacity constraints, regulatory issues or\\nquality control problems in their operations, or fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery, our ability to ship and deliver certain of our hardware systems products to our customers could be impaired and our hardware systems business\\ncould be harmed.  We have simplified our supply chain processes by reducing the number of third party manufacturing partners and the number of\\nlocations where these third party manufacturers build our hardware systems products. We therefore have become more dependent on a fewer number of these manufacturing partners and locations. If these partners experience production problems or delays\\nor cannot meet our demand for products, we may not be able to find alternate manufacturing sources in a timely or cost effective manner, if at all. If we are required to change third party manufacturers, our ability to meet our scheduled hardware\\nsystems products deliveries to our customers could be adversely affected, which could cause the loss of sales and existing or potential customers, delayed revenue recognition or an increase in our hardware systems products expenses, all of which\\ncould adversely affect the margins of our hardware business.  These challenges and risks also exist when we acquire companies with hardware\\nproducts and related supply chain operations. In some cases, we may be dependent, at least initially, on these acquired companies\\x92 supply chain operations that we are less familiar with and thus we may be slower to adjust or react to these\\nchallenges and risks.  Our software indirect sales channel could affect our future operating results.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our\\nsoftware indirect channel network is comprised primarily of resellers, system integrators/implementers, consultants, education providers, internet service providers, network integrators and independent software vendors. Our relationships with these\\nchannel participants are important elements of our software marketing and sales efforts. Our financial results could be adversely affected if our contracts with channel participants were terminated, if our relationships with channel participants\\nwere to deteriorate, if any of our competitors enter into strategic relationships with or acquire a significant channel participant, if the financial condition or operations of our channel participants were to weaken or if the level of demand for\\nour channel participants\\x92 products and services were to decrease. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining, expanding or developing our relationships with channel participants. If we are not successful, we may lose\\nsales opportunities, customers and revenues.  We may not be able to protect our intellectual property\\nrights.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We rely on copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts, these\\nprotections may be limited. Unauthorized third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer portions of our products or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property. Any patents owned by us may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. Any of\\nour pending or future patent applications, whether or not being currently challenged, may not be issued with the scope of the claims we seek, if at all. In addition, the laws of some countries do not provide the same level of protection of our\\nintellectual property rights as do the laws and courts of the United States. If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use, or other misappropriation, we may not remain competitive. \\nThird parties have claimed and, in the future, may claim infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights and/or breach of license agreement\\nprovisions.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We periodically receive notices from, or have lawsuits filed against us by, others claiming infringement or other misuse of their intellectual property rights and/or breach of our agreements with them.\\nThese third parties include entities that do not have the capabilities to design, manufacture, or distribute products or services or that acquire intellectual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual\\nproperty through asserting claims of infringement and misuse. We expect the number of such claims will increase as:   \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we continue to acquire companies and expand into new businesses; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the use and support of third party code (including open source code) becomes more prevalent in the industry; \\n \\xa0 28 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the volume of issued patents continues to increase; and \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the proliferation of non-practicing entities asserting intellectual property infringement claims increases. \\nResponding to any such claim, regardless of its validity, could:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n be time consuming, costly and result in litigation;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n divert management\\x92s time and attention from developing our business; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable;\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n require us to stop selling or to redesign certain of our products; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n require us to release source code to third parties, possibly under open source license terms; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n require us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers; or \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. \\nWe may lose key employees or may be unable to hire enough qualified employees.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We rely on the continued service of\\nour senior management, including our Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Technology Officer and founder, our Chief Executive Officers, other members of our executive team and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified\\nemployees. In the technology industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business, product development, technical and other personnel. In addition, acquisitions could cause us to lose key personnel of the acquired\\ncompanies or at Oracle. We may also experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher sales. We may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel.\\nWith rare exceptions, we do not have long-term employment or non-competition agreements with our employees. Members of our senior management team have left Oracle over the years for a variety of reasons, and we cannot assure you that there will not\\nbe additional departures, which may be disruptive to our operations.  We continually focus on improving our cost structure by hiring personnel\\nin countries where advanced technical expertise and other expertise are available at lower costs. When we make adjustments to our workforce, we may incur expenses associated with workforce reductions that delay the benefit of a more efficient\\nworkforce structure. We may also experience increased competition for employees in these countries as the trend toward globalization continues, which may affect our employee retention efforts and increase our expenses in an effort to offer a\\ncompetitive compensation program. Our general compensation program includes stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs), which are important tools in attracting and retaining employees in our industry. If our stock price performs poorly, it may\\nadversely affect our ability to retain or attract employees. In addition, because we expense all stock-based compensation, we have changed and may in the future change our stock-based and other compensation practices. For example, in fiscal 2015, we\\nintroduced RSU grants for certain of our employees and performance related stock unit grants for certain of our executives. We continue to evaluate our compensation practices and other changes we consider from time to time include a reduction in the\\nnumber of employees granted equity awards, a reduction in the number of stock options or RSUs granted per employee and alternative forms of stock-based compensation, all of which may have an impact on our ability to retain employees and also impact\\nthe amount of stock-based compensation expense that we record. Any changes in our compensation practices or changes made by competitors could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel. \\nOur sales to government clients subject us to business volatility and risks, including government budgeting cycles and appropriations, early\\ntermination, audits, investigations, sanctions and penalties.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We derive revenues from contracts with the U.S. government, state and local governments, and foreign governments and their respective agencies, which may\\nterminate most of these contracts at any time, without cause. There is increased pressure for governments and their agencies, both domestically and internationally, to reduce spending. Further, our U.S. federal government contracts are subject to\\nthe approval of appropriations made by the U.S. Congress to fund the expenditures under these contracts. Similarly, our contracts at the state and local levels in the U.S. and our contracts with foreign governments and their agencies are generally\\nsubject to government \\n \\xa0 29 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nfunding authorizations. Additionally, government contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations which could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative\\nsanctions, including termination of contracts, refund of a portion of fees received, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business. \\nWe may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The intense competition we face in the sales of our\\nproducts and services and general economic and business conditions can put pressure on us to change our prices. If our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable,\\nwe may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully. Any such changes may reduce margins and could adversely affect operating results. Additionally, the increasing prevalence of cloud and SaaS delivery models\\noffered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our on-premises enterprise software offerings and our cloud offerings, as well as overall demand for our on-premises software product and service offerings, which could reduce\\nour revenues and profitability. Our software license updates and product support fees and hardware systems support fees are generally priced as a percentage of our net new software licenses fees and net new hardware systems products fees,\\nrespectively. Our competitors may offer lower pricing on their support offerings, which could put pressure on us to further discount our product or support pricing.  Any broad-based change to our prices and pricing policies could cause our revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies. Some of our\\ncompetitors may bundle products for promotional purposes or as a long-term pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations. These practices could, over time, significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for\\ncertain of our products. If we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of our products or changes in customer demand, our revenues could decrease. The increase in open source software distribution may also cause us to\\nchange our pricing models.  We may not receive significant revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years,\\nif at all.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Developing software, cloud and hardware offerings is expensive and the investment in the development of these offerings often involves a long return on investment cycle. An important element of our corporate\\nstrategy is to continue to make significant investments in research and development and related product and service opportunities both through internal investments and the acquisition of intellectual property from companies that we have acquired.\\nAccelerated product and service introductions and short software and hardware life cycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by revenue increases. We\\nbelieve that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. However, we do not expect to receive significant revenues from these investments for several\\nyears, if at all.  Business disruptions could adversely affect our operating results.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0A significant\\nportion of our critical business operations are concentrated in a few geographic areas. We are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems could cause delays in completing sales and providing services, including some of\\nour cloud offerings. A major earthquake, fire or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a\\nresult, our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected.  Adverse litigation results could affect our\\nbusiness.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We are subject to various legal proceedings. Litigation can be lengthy, expensive and disruptive to our operations, and can divert our management\\x92s attention away from running our core business. The\\nresults of our litigation also cannot be predicted with certainty. An adverse decision could result in monetary damages or injunctive relief that could affect our business, operating results or financial condition. Additional information regarding\\ncertain of the lawsuits we are involved in is discussed under Note\\xa018 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.   We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in both the\\nUnited States and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities and those authorities often do not\\nagree with positions taken by us on our tax returns. \\n \\xa0 30 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significantly adverse impact on our effective tax rate. For\\nexample, the United States, many countries in the EU, and other countries where we do business, are actively considering changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to\\ncorporate multinationals, which, if enacted, could have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. Further, in the ordinary course of a global business, there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax\\ndetermination is uncertain. Our intercompany transfer pricing has been and is currently being reviewed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and by foreign tax jurisdictions and will likely be subject to additional audits in the future.\\nAlthough, we have negotiated certain unilateral Advance Pricing Agreements with the IRS and certain selected bilateral Advance Pricing Agreements that cover some of our intercompany transfer pricing issues and preclude the relevant tax authorities\\nfrom making a transfer pricing adjustment within the scope of these agreements, these agreements do not cover substantial elements of our transfer pricing. In recent periods, transfer pricing audits in many foreign jurisdictions have become\\nincreasingly contentious. Similarly, certain jurisdictions are increasingly raising concerns about certain withholding tax matters. In addition, our provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in\\njurisdictions which we consider to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States that have lower statutory tax rates and earnings being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates. \\nWe are also subject to non-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the\\nUnited States and various foreign jurisdictions. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities with respect to these non-income based taxes and may have exposure to additional non-income based tax liabilities. Our acquisition activities have\\nincreased our non-income based tax exposures, particularly with our entry into the hardware systems business, which increased the volume and complexity of laws and regulations that we are subject to and with which we must comply.\\nAlthough we believe that our income and non-income based tax estimates are reasonable, there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or\\ntax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Charges to earnings\\nresulting from acquisitions may adversely affect our operating results.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Under business combination accounting standards pursuant to ASC 805, Business Combinations, we recognize the identifiable assets acquired,\\nthe liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interests in acquired companies generally at their acquisition date fair values and, in each case, separately from goodwill. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess amount of\\nconsideration transferred, which is also generally measured at fair value, and the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed\\nto be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain. After we complete an acquisition, the following factors could result in material charges and adversely affect our operating results and may adversely affect our cash flows: \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n costs incurred to combine the operations of companies we acquire, such as transitional employee expenses and employee retention, redeployment or\\nrelocation expenses;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n impairment of goodwill, in particular within our consulting reporting unit, or impairment of intangible assets, both of which we have added to\\nsignificantly in recent years and may continue to increase in the future;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n amortization of intangible assets acquired;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n a reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets acquired; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n identification of, or changes to, assumed contingent liabilities, both income tax and non-income tax related, after our final determination of the\\namounts for these contingencies or the conclusion of the measurement period (generally up to one year from the acquisition date), whichever comes first; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n charges to our operating results to maintain certain duplicative pre-merger activities for an extended period of time or to maintain these activities\\nfor a period of time that is longer than we had anticipated, charges to eliminate certain duplicative pre-merger activities, and charges to restructure our operations or to reduce our cost structure; \\n \\xa0 31 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n charges to our operating results due to expenses incurred to effect the acquisition; and \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n charges to our operating results due to the expensing of certain stock awards assumed in an acquisition. \\nSubstantially all of these costs will be accounted for as expenses that will decrease our net income and earnings per share for the periods in which those\\ncosts are incurred. For example, we recognized a goodwill impairment loss in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 relating to our hardware systems reporting unit. Charges to our operating results in any given period could differ substantially from\\nother periods based on the timing and size of our future acquisitions and the extent of integration activities. A more detailed discussion of our accounting for business combinations and other items is presented in the \\x93Critical Accounting\\nPolicies and Estimates\\x94 section of Management\\x92s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 7). \\nThere are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0As of May\\xa031, 2015, we had an aggregate\\nof $42.0 billion of outstanding indebtedness that will mature between calendar year 2016 and calendar year 2055 and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is\\ndependent upon our ability to manage our business operations, generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt and the other factors discussed in this section. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks\\nsuccessfully.  We may also need to refinance a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to\\nrefinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon\\nrefinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. Should we incur future increases in interest expense, our ability to utilize certain of our foreign tax credits to reduce our U.S. federal income tax\\ncould be limited, which could unfavorably affect our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. In addition, changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity\\nsecurities and increase the interest amounts we pay on outstanding or future debt. These risks could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  Environmental and other related laws and regulations subject us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Some of our cloud and\\nhardware systems operations are subject to state, federal and international laws governing protection of the environment, proper handling and disposal of materials used for these products, human health and safety, the use of certain chemical\\nsubstances and the labor practices of suppliers. We endeavor to comply with these environmental and other laws, yet compliance with these environmental and other laws could increase our product design, development, procurement, manufacturing,\\ndelivery and administration costs, limit our ability to manage excess and obsolete non-compliant inventory, change our sales activities, or otherwise impact future financial results of our cloud and hardware systems businesses. Any violation of\\nthese laws can subject us to significant liability, including fines, penalties and possible prohibition of sales of our products and services into one or more states or countries and result in a material adverse effect on the financial condition or\\nresults of operations of our cloud and hardware systems businesses.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted disclosure\\nrequirements for companies that use certain \\x93conflict minerals\\x94 (commonly referred to as tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold) in their products. Our supply chain is multi-tiered, global and highly complex. As a provider of hardware systems\\nend products, we are several steps removed from the mining and smelting or refining of any conflict minerals in our supply chain. Accordingly, our ability to determine with certainty the origin and chain of custody of conflict minerals is limited.\\nOur relationships with customers and suppliers could suffer if we are unable to describe our products as \\x93conflict-free.\\x94 We may also face increased costs in complying with conflict minerals disclosure requirements. \\nA significant portion of our hardware systems revenues come from international sales. Environmental legislation, such as the EU Directive on Restriction\\nof Hazardous Substances (RoHS), the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive) and China\\x92s regulation on Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products, may increase our cost\\nof doing business internationally and impact our hardware systems revenues from the EU, China and other countries with similar environmental legislation as we endeavor to comply with and implement these requirements. The cumulative impact of\\ninternational environmental legislation could be significant. \\n \\xa0 32 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Our stock price could become more volatile and your investment could lose\\nvalue.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0All of the factors discussed in this section could affect our stock price. The timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products, product enhancements or technological advances by our\\ncompetitors or us and any announcements by us of acquisitions, major transactions, or management changes could also affect our stock price. Changes in the amounts and frequency of share repurchases or dividends could adversely affect our stock\\nprice. Our stock price is subject to speculation in the press and the analyst community, changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts, changes in investors\\x92 or analysts\\x92 valuation measures for our stock, our\\ncredit ratings and market trends unrelated to our performance. A significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class actions lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and divert management\\x92s\\nattention and resources, which could adversely affect our business. \\nItem\\xa01B.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Unresolved Staff Comments  None.  Item\\xa02.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Properties\\n Our properties consist of owned and leased office facilities for sales, support, research and development, consulting, manufacturing and\\nadministrative personnel.

In June 2015, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share of our outstanding\\ncommon stock payable on July\\xa029, 2015 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July\\xa08, 2015. We currently expect to continue paying comparable cash dividends on a quarterly basis; however, future declarations of dividends\\nand the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.  For equity\\ncompensation plan information, please refer to Item\\xa012 in Part III of this Annual Report.  Stock Repurchase Programs\\n Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On September\\xa018, 2014, we\\nannounced that our Board of Directors approved an expansion of our stock repurchase program by an additional $13.0\\xa0billion. Approximately $9.2 billion remained available for stock repurchases as of May\\xa031, 2015 pursuant to our stock\\nrepurchase program.  Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on\\nfactors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be\\neffected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan.

This overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and\\njudgments incorporated in our reported financial results. We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition.  Business Overview  Oracle Corporation provides products and services that address all\\naspects of corporate information technology (IT) environments\\x97application, platform and infrastructure\\x97and are available to customers either via cloud computing or on-premises deployment models. Our products include database and middleware\\nsoftware, application software, cloud infrastructure software, and hardware systems (Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, networking and industry specific products), along with support and related services. We offer over 400,000 worldwide\\ncustomers a choice of deployment models to best suit their needs including (1)\\xa0the deployment of our products via our Oracle Cloud offerings, (2)\\xa0the acquisition of Oracle products and services for an on-premises IT environment or\\n(3)\\xa0a mix of these two models.  For customers opting for a cloud computing model, Oracle offers a wide range of services in all three\\nprimary layers of the cloud: Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Our Oracle Cloud offerings are designed to be: rapidly deployable to enable customers shorter time to innovation; easily\\nmaintainable to reduce integration and testing work; and cost effective by requiring lower upfront customer investment. Our Oracle Cloud offerings integrate the software, hardware and services on the customers\\x92 behalf in IT environments that we\\ndeploy, support and manage for the customer. We are a leader in the core technologies of cloud IT environments, including database and middleware software as well as enterprise applications, virtualization, clustering, large-scale systems management\\nand related infrastructure. Our products and services are the building blocks of our Oracle Cloud services, our partners\\x92 cloud services and our customers\\x92 cloud IT environments.  In addition to offering a broad spectrum of cloud products and services, Oracle for decades has developed and sold its products and services to our customers worldwide for use in their global data centers\\nand on-premises IT environments. An important element of our corporate strategy is to continue our investments in, and innovation with respect to, our products and services that we offer through our software and cloud, hardware and services\\nbusinesses. In fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, we invested $5.5 billion, $5.2 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively, in research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of products and services and to develop new products and services. We\\nhave a deep understanding as to how all components within IT environments\\x97application, platform and infrastructure\\x97interact and function with one another. We focus our development efforts on improving the performance, operation and\\nintegration of these differing technologies to make them more cost-effective and easier to deploy, manage and maintain for our customers and to improve their computing performance relative to our competitors. After purchasing Oracle products and\\nservices, customers can continue to take advantage of Oracle\\x92s research and development investments and deep IT expertise by purchasing and renewing Oracle support offerings, which may include product enhancements that we periodically deliver\\nto our Oracle E-Business Suite, Siebel, PeopleSoft and JD Edwards application software products, among others, or renewing their SaaS, PaaS and IaaS contracts with us.  Oracle customers are increasingly electing to run their IT environments using our suite of Oracle Cloud offerings. As customers deploy with the Oracle Cloud, many are adopting a hybrid IT model whereby\\ncertain of their IT resources are deployed and managed through the Oracle Cloud, while other of their IT resources are deployed and managed on-premises, and both sets of resources can be managed as one. We focus the engineering of our products and\\nservices to best connect these different deployment models to enable flexibility, ease, agility, compatibility, extensibility and seamlessness. \\nA selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. We believe our acquisitions enhance the products and\\nservices that we can offer to customers, expand our customer base, provide greater scale to accelerate innovation, grow our revenues and earnings, and increase stockholder value. \\n \\xa0 37 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nIn recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of companies, products, services and technologies that add to, are complementary to, or have otherwise enhanced our\\nexisting offerings. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies to further our corporate strategy.  We have\\nthree businesses that deliver our application, platform and infrastructure technologies: software and cloud, hardware systems, and services. These businesses can be further divided into certain operating segments (Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated\\nFinancial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, provides additional information related to our operating segments). Each of our businesses and operating segments has unique characteristics and faces different opportunities and\\nchallenges. Although we report our actual results in U.S. Dollars, we conduct a significant number of transactions in currencies other than U.S. Dollars. Therefore, we present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how\\nour underlying businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations. An overview of our three businesses and related operating segments follows.  Software and Cloud Business  Our software and cloud business, which\\nrepresented 77%, 76% and 75% of our total revenues in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, is comprised of three operating segments: (1)\\xa0new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions, (2)\\xa0cloud infrastructure as a service and\\n(3)\\xa0software license updates and product support. On a constant currency basis, we expect that our software and cloud business\\x92 total revenues generally will continue to increase due to continued demand for our software products and cloud\\nsoftware subscription offerings, our software license updates and product support offerings, including the high percentage of customers that renew their software license updates and product support contracts, and our acquisitions, which should allow\\nus to grow and continue to make investments in research and development.  New Software Licenses and Cloud Software\\nSubscriptions:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions line of business markets, sells and delivers our application and platform technologies including our SaaS and PaaS offerings (our SaaS and PaaS\\nofferings are collectively referred to as cloud software subscriptions), which provide customers a choice of software applications and platforms that are delivered via a cloud-based IT environment that we host, manage and support, and the licensing\\nof our software products including Oracle Applications, Oracle Database, Oracle Fusion Middleware and Java, among others. Our application and platform technologies are substantially built on standards-based architectures that are designed to help\\ncustomers reduce the cost and complexity of their IT infrastructure. Our commitment to industry standards results in software that works in customer environments with Oracle or non-Oracle hardware or software components and that can be adapted to\\nmeet specific industry or business needs. We focus the engineering of our products and services to best connect cloud and on-premises deployment models to enable flexibility, ease, agility, compatibility, extensibility and seamlessness. Our software\\nofferings are substantially designed to operate on both single server and clustered server configurations for cloud or on-premises IT environments, and to support a choice of operating systems including Oracle Solaris, Oracle Linux, Microsoft\\nWindows and third party UNIX products, among others. These approaches are designed to support customer choice and reduce customer risk. Our customers include businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers. We\\nmarket and sell our software products and services to these customers with a sales force positioned to offer the combinations that best fit their needs. We enable customers to evolve and transform to substantially any IT environment at whatever pace\\nis most appropriate for them.  The growth in our new software licenses and our SaaS and PaaS revenues that we report is affected by the\\nstrength of general economic and business conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, the competitive position of our software offerings, our acquisitions and foreign currency fluctuations. The substantial majority of our new software license\\ntransactions are characterized by long sales cycles and the timing of a few large software license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly new software licenses revenues. New software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues\\nrepresented 26% of our total revenues in fiscal 2015 and 28% in each of fiscal 2014 and 2013. Our cloud software subscriptions contracts, which consist of SaaS and PaaS arrangements, are generally one to three years in duration and we strive to\\nrenew these contracts when they are eligible for renewal. Our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions segment\\x92s margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to\\nthe historical \\n \\xa0 38 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nupward trend of our new software licenses revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this segment are predominantly fixed in the short-term. However, our new\\nsoftware licenses and cloud software subscriptions segment\\x92s margin has been and will continue to be affected by the fair value adjustments relating to the cloud SaaS and PaaS obligations that we assumed in our business combinations (described\\nfurther below) and by the amortization of intangible assets associated with companies and technologies that we have acquired.  For certain of\\nour acquired businesses, we recorded adjustments to reduce the cloud SaaS and PaaS obligations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. As a result, as required by business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize cloud\\nSaaS and PaaS revenues related to acquired contracts that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $12 million, $17 million and $45 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\\nTo the extent underlying cloud SaaS and PaaS contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of these contracts over their respective contractual periods. \\nCloud Infrastructure as a Service:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our cloud infrastructure as a service offerings, which represented 2% of our total\\nrevenues in fiscal 2015 and 1% in each of fiscal 2014 and 2013, provide comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services for customer IT infrastructure for a fee for a stated term that is hosted at our Oracle data center\\nfacilities, select partner data centers or physically on-premises at customer facilities; deployment and management offerings for our software and hardware and related IT infrastructure including virtual machine instances that are subscription-based\\nand designed for computing and reliable and secure object storage; and certain of our Oracle Engineered Systems and related support offerings that are deployed in our customers\\x92 data centers for a monthly fee. \\nSoftware License Updates and Product Support:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Customers that purchase software license updates and product support\\nare granted rights to unspecified product upgrades and maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period, as well as technical support assistance. Our software license updates and product support contracts are generally\\none year in duration. Substantially all of our software license customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually. The growth of software license updates and product support revenues is primarily influenced by\\nthree factors: (1)\\xa0the percentage of our software support contract customer base that renews its software support contracts, (2)\\xa0the amount of new software support contracts sold in connection with the sale of new software licenses and\\n(3)\\xa0the amount of software support contracts assumed from companies we have acquired.  Software license updates and product support\\nrevenues, which represented 49%, 47% and 46% of our total revenues in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, is our highest margin business unit. Our software support margins during fiscal 2015 were 90% and accounted for 81% of our total margins\\nover the same period. Our software license updates and product support margins have been affected by fair value adjustments relating to software support obligations assumed in business combinations (described further below) and by amortization of\\nintangible assets. However, over the longer term, we believe that software license updates and product support revenues and margins will grow for the following reasons:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software support contracts when eligible for renewal;\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n substantially all of our customers purchase software license updates and product support contracts when they buy new software licenses, resulting in a\\nfurther increase in our software support contract base. Even if new software licenses revenues growth was flat, software license updates and product support revenues would continue to grow in comparison to the corresponding prior year periods\\nassuming contract renewal and cancellation rates and foreign currency rates remained relatively constant since substantially all new software licenses transactions result in the sale of software license updates and product support contracts, which\\nadd to our software support contract base; and  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n our acquisitions have increased our software support contract base, as well as the portfolio of products available to be licensed and supported.\\n We recorded adjustments to reduce software support obligations assumed in business combinations to their estimated fair\\nvalues at the acquisition dates. As a result, as required by business combination accounting rules, \\n \\xa0 39 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nwe did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to software support contracts that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent\\nentities in the amounts of $11 million, $3 million and $14 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. To the extent underlying software support contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the\\nfull values of the software support contracts over the respective support periods, the majority of which are one year.  Hardware\\nSystems Business   Our hardware systems business is comprised of two operating segments: (1)\\xa0hardware systems products and\\n(2)\\xa0hardware systems support. Our hardware business represented 14% of our total revenues in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013. We expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our software and cloud\\nbusiness due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services, including direct materials and labor costs. We expect to make investments in research and development to improve existing\\nhardware products and services and to develop new hardware products and services.  Hardware Systems\\nProducts:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We provide a broad selection of hardware systems and related services including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, networking, workstations and related devices, industry specific hardware,\\nvirtualization software, operating systems, and management software to support diverse IT environments, including cloud computing environments. We engineer our hardware systems with virtualization and management capabilities to enable the rapid\\ndeployment and efficient management of cloud and on-premises IT infrastructures. Our hardware products support many of the world\\x92s largest cloud infrastructures, including the Oracle Cloud. \\nOur hardware systems products are designed to be easier to deploy, manage and maintain for our customers and to improve computing performance relative to\\nour competitors\\x92 offerings. We design our hardware products to seamlessly connect on-premises and cloud IT environments to further enable interoperability, interchangeability and extendibility and to work in customer environments that may\\ninclude other Oracle or non-Oracle hardware or software components. Our flexible and open approach provides Oracle customers with a broad range of choices in how they deploy our hardware products, which we believe is a priority for our customers.\\n Oracle Engineered Systems are core to our hardware offerings and are important elements of our data center and cloud computing offerings\\nincluding the Oracle Cloud. These pre-integrated products are designed to integrate multiple Oracle technology components to work together to deliver improved performance, availability, security and operational efficiency relative to our\\ncompetitors\\x92 products, to be upgraded effectively and efficiently and to simplify maintenance cycles by providing a single solution for software patching. Oracle Engineered Systems are tested before they are shipped to customers and delivered\\nready-to-run, enabling customers to shorten the time to production.  We offer a wide range of server systems using our SPARC microprocessor.\\nOur SPARC servers run the Oracle Solaris operating system and are designed to be differentiated by their reliability, security, and scalability. Our mid-size and large servers are designed to offer better performance and lower total cost of\\nownership than mainframe systems for business critical applications, for customers having more computationally intensive needs, and as platforms for building cloud computing IT environments. Our SPARC servers are also a core component of the Oracle\\nSuperCluster, one of our Oracle Engineered Systems.  We also offer enterprise x86 servers. These x86 servers are based on microprocessors from\\nIntel Corporation and are compatible with Oracle Solaris, Oracle Linux, Microsoft Windows and other operating systems. Our x86 servers are also a core component of many of our Oracle Engineered Systems including Oracle Exadata Database Machine,\\nOracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud, Oracle Exalytics In-Memory Machine and the Oracle Big Data Appliance.  Our storage products are designed to\\nsecurely manage, protect, archive and restore customers\\x92 mission critical data assets and consist of tape, disk, flash and hardware-related software including file systems software, back-up and archive software and storage management software\\nand networking for mainframe and open systems environments. \\n \\xa0 40 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Our networking and data center fabric products, including Oracle Virtual Networking, and Oracle InfiniBand\\nand Ethernet technologies, are used with our server and storage products and are integrated into our management tools to help enterprise customers improve infrastructure performance, reduce cost and complexity and simplify storage and server\\nconnectivity.  We offer hardware products and services designed for specific industries. Our point-of-sale hardware offerings include\\npoint-of-sale terminals and related hardware that are designed for managing businesses within the food and beverage, hotel and retail industries, among others. Our hardware products and services for communications networks include network signaling,\\npolicy control and subscriber data management solutions, and session border control technology, among others.  The majority of our hardware\\nsystems products are sold through indirect channels, including independent distributors and value added resellers.  To produce our hardware\\nproducts, we rely on both our internal manufacturing operations as well as third party manufacturing partners. Our internal manufacturing operations consist primarily of materials procurement, assembly, testing and quality control of our Oracle\\nEngineered Systems and certain of our enterprise and data center servers and storage systems. For all other manufacturing, we generally rely on third party manufacturing partners to produce our hardware related components and hardware products and\\nwe may involve our internal manufacturing operations in the final assembly, testing and quality control processes for these components and products. We distribute most of our hardware products either from our facilities or partner facilities. We\\nstrive to reduce costs by simplifying our manufacturing processes through increased standardization of components across product types and a \\x93build-to-order\\x94 manufacturing process in which products generally are built only after customers\\nhave placed firm orders.  Our hardware systems products revenues, cost of hardware systems products and hardware systems operating margins that\\nwe report are affected by our strategy for and the competitive position of our hardware systems products, the strength of general economic and business conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, certain of our acquisitions and foreign currency\\nrate fluctuations. In addition, our operating margins for our hardware systems products segment have been and will be affected by the amortization of intangible assets.  Our quarterly hardware systems products revenues are difficult to predict. The timing of customer orders and delays in our ability to timely manufacture or deliver a few large hardware transactions, among\\nother factors, could substantially affect the amount of hardware systems products revenues, expenses and operating margins that we report. \\nHardware Systems Support:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our hardware systems support offerings provide customers with software updates for software\\ncomponents that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products, such as Oracle Solaris and certain other software products, and can include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Typically, our hardware\\nsystems support contract arrangements are priced as a percentage of the net hardware systems products fees, are invoiced to the customer at the beginning of the support period and are one year in duration. We continue to evolve hardware systems\\nsupport processes that are intended to proactively identify and solve quality issues and to increase the amount of new and renewed hardware systems support contracts sold in connection with the sales of our hardware systems products. Our hardware\\nsystems support revenues that we report are influenced by a number of factors, including the volume of purchases of hardware products, the mix of hardware products purchased, whether customers decide to purchase hardware systems support contracts at\\nor in close proximity to the time of hardware product sale, the percentage of our hardware systems support contract customer base that renews its support contracts and our acquisitions. Substantially all of these factors are heavily influenced by\\nour customers\\x92 decisions to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware systems\\x92 infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available.  Our hardware systems support margins have been and will be affected by certain of our acquisitions and related accounting, including fair value adjustments relating to hardware systems support obligations\\nassumed, and by the amortization of intangible assets. As required by business combination accounting rules, we recorded adjustments to reduce our hardware systems support revenues for contracts assumed from our acquisitions to their estimated fair\\nvalues. These amounts would have been recorded as hardware systems support revenues by \\n \\xa0 41 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nthe acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $4 million, $11 million and $14 million for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. To the extent underlying hardware systems\\nsupport contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of the hardware systems support contracts over the respective support periods. \\nServices Business   Our\\nservices business, which represented 9%, 10% and 11% of our total revenues in fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, respectively, is comprised of the remainder of our operating segments. Our services business has lower margins than our software\\nand cloud and hardware businesses. Our services revenues are impacted by our strategy for and the competitive position of our services, certain of our acquisitions, general economic conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, personnel\\nreductions in our customers\\x92 IT departments, tighter controls over discretionary spending and the growth in our software and hardware systems products revenues. Our services business\\x92 offerings include: \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n consulting services that are designed to help our customers and global system integrator partners more successfully architect and deploy our products,\\nincluding IT strategy alignment, enterprise architecture planning and design, initial product implementation and integration, and ongoing product enhancements and upgrades. We utilize a global, blended delivery model to optimize value for our\\ncustomers and partners, consisting of on-premises consultants from local geographies, industry specialists and consultants from our global delivery and solution centers; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n advanced customer support services, which are provided on-premises and remotely to our customers to enable increased performance and higher\\navailability of their Oracle products and services; and  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n education services for Oracle products and services, including training and certification programs that are offered to customers, partners and\\nemployees through a variety of formats, including instructor-led classes at our education centers, live virtual training, self-paced online training, private events and custom training. \\nAcquisitions  A selective\\nand active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies, products, services and technologies including MICROS\\nSystems, Inc. (MICROS) in fiscal 2015, Responsys, Inc. (Responsys) and Tekelec Global, Inc. (Tekelec) in fiscal 2014, and Acme Packet, Inc. (Acme Packet) in fiscal 2013, among others. We believe our acquisition program strengthens our competitive\\nposition, enhances the products and services that we can offer to customers, expands our customer base, provides greater scale to accelerate innovation, grows our revenues and earnings and increases stockholder value. We expect to continue to\\nacquire companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy. Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provides additional information related to our recent\\nacquisitions.  We believe we can fund our future acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities,\\ncash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flow and return on invested capital\\ntargets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates \\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the Financial\\nAccounting Standards Board\\x92s (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) and we consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). GAAP, as set\\nforth within the ASC, requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these\\n\\n \\xa0 42 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nestimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as\\nwell as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The accounting\\npolicies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following: \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Revenue Recognition  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Business Combinations  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Goodwill and Intangible Assets\\x97Impairment Assessments \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Accounting for Income Taxes  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Legal and Other Contingencies  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Stock-Based Compensation \\nIn many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management\\x92s judgment in\\nits application. There are also areas in which management\\x92s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. Our senior management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and related\\ndisclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.  Revenue Recognition \\nOur sources of revenues include: (1)\\xa0software and cloud revenues, including new software licenses revenues earned from granting licenses to use our\\nsoftware products and industry specific software; cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues generated from fees for granting customers access to a broad range of our software and related support offerings on a subscription basis in a secure, standards-based\\ncloud computing environment; cloud IaaS revenues generated from fees for deployment and management offerings for our software and hardware and related IT infrastructure generally on a subscription basis; and software license updates and product\\nsupport revenues (described further below); (2)\\xa0hardware systems revenues, which include the sale of hardware systems products including Oracle Engineered Systems, computer servers, storage products, networking and data center fabric products,\\nand industry specific hardware; and hardware systems support revenues; and (3)\\xa0services, which include software and hardware related services including consulting, advanced customer support and education revenues. Revenues generally are\\nrecognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.  Revenue Recognition for\\nSoftware Products and Software Related Services (Software Elements)  New software licenses revenues primarily represent fees earned from\\ngranting customers licenses to use our database, middleware and application software and exclude cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues and revenues derived from software license updates, which are included in software license updates and product support\\nrevenues. The basis for our new software licenses revenue recognition is substantially governed by the accounting guidance contained in ASC 985-605, Software-Revenue Recognition. We exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the\\ndetermination of the amount of software and software related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period.  For software\\nlicense arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software, we recognize new software licenses revenues when: (1)\\xa0we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of\\nsoftware; (2)\\xa0we deliver the products; (3)\\xa0the sale price is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties; and (4)\\xa0collection is probable. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because\\nthe foregoing conditions are not met, are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met.  Substantially all of our software license\\narrangements do not include acceptance provisions. However, if acceptance provisions exist as part of public policy, for example, in agreements with government entities where \\n \\xa0 43 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nacceptance periods are required by law, or within previously executed terms and conditions that are referenced in the current agreement and are short-term in nature, we generally recognize\\nrevenues upon delivery provided the acceptance terms are perfunctory and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. If acceptance provisions are not perfunctory (for example, acceptance provisions that are long-term in nature or are not\\nincluded as standard terms of an arrangement), revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period.  The vast majority of our software license arrangements include software license updates and product support contracts, which are entered into at the customer\\x92s option and are recognized ratably over\\nthe term of the arrangement, typically one year. Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period. Product support\\nincludes internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel. Software license updates and product support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net new software licenses\\nfees. Substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually.  Revenue Recognition\\nfor Multiple-Element Arrangements\\x97Software Products and Software Related Services (Software Arrangements)  We often enter into\\narrangements with customers that purchase both software related products and software related services from us at the same time, or within close proximity of one another (referred to as software related multiple-element arrangements). Such software\\nrelated multiple-element arrangements include the sale of our software products, software license updates and product support contracts and other software related services whereby software license delivery is followed by the subsequent or\\ncontemporaneous delivery of the other elements. For those software related multiple-element arrangements, we have applied the residual method to determine the amount of new software license revenues to be recognized pursuant to ASC 985-605. Under\\nthe residual method, if fair value exists for undelivered elements in a multiple-element arrangement, such fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred with the remaining portion of the arrangement consideration generally recognized upon\\ndelivery of the software license. We allocate the fair value of each element of a software related multiple-element arrangement based upon its fair value as determined by our vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE\\x97described further below),\\nwith any remaining amount allocated to the software license.  Revenue Recognition for Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS Offerings, Hardware Systems\\nProducts, Hardware Systems Support and Related Services (Nonsoftware Elements)  Our revenue recognition policy for nonsoftware deliverables\\nincluding cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, hardware systems products, support and related services is based upon the accounting guidance contained in ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition, Multiple-Element Arrangements, and we exercise\\njudgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues, hardware systems products revenues, support and related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period. \\nRevenues from the sales of our nonsoftware elements are recognized when: (1)\\xa0persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2)\\xa0we deliver the\\nproducts and passage of the title to the buyer occurs; (3)\\xa0the sale price is fixed or determinable; and (4)\\xa0collection is reasonably assured. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met\\nare recognized when those conditions are subsequently met. When applicable, we reduce revenues for estimated returns or certain other incentive programs where we have the ability to sufficiently estimate the effects of these items. Where an\\narrangement is subject to acceptance criteria and the acceptance provisions are not perfunctory (for example, acceptance provisions that are long-term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement), revenues are recognized upon\\nthe earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period.  Our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings generally\\nprovide customers access to certain of our software within a cloud-based IT environment that we manage, host and support and offer to customers on a subscription basis. Revenues for our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings are generally recognized ratably\\nover the contract term commencing with the date the service is made available to customers and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. \\n \\xa0 44 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Our cloud IaaS offerings provide deployment and management offerings for our software and hardware and\\nrelated IT infrastructure including comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services arrangements for customer IT infrastructure for a stated term that is hosted at our data center facilities, select partner data centers or\\nphysically on-premises at customer facilities generally for a term-based fee; and virtual machine instances that are subscription-based and designed for computing and reliable and secure object storage. Revenues for these cloud IaaS offerings are\\ngenerally recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date the service is made available to customers and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied.  Revenues from the sale of hardware systems products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of our Oracle Engineered Systems, computer servers, storage, networking and industry specific hardware.\\n Our hardware systems support offerings generally provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the\\nfunctionality of our hardware products and can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware systems support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware systems products fees.\\nHardware systems support contracts are entered into at the customer\\x92s option and are recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangements, which are typically one year.  Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements\\x97Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS Offerings, Hardware Systems Products, Hardware Systems Support and Related Services (Nonsoftware Arrangements)\\n We enter into arrangements with customers that purchase both nonsoftware related products and services from us at the same time, or within\\nclose proximity of one another (referred to as nonsoftware multiple-element arrangements). Each element within a nonsoftware multiple-element arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting provided the following criteria are met: the\\ndelivered products or services have value to the customer on a standalone basis; and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services, delivery or performance of the undelivered product or\\nservice is considered probable and is substantially controlled by us. We consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by us or another vendor or could be resold by the customer. Further, our revenue\\narrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products. Where the aforementioned criteria for a separate unit of accounting are not met, the deliverable is combined with the undelivered element(s) and\\ntreated as a single unit of accounting for the purposes of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition. For those units of accounting that include more than one deliverable but are treated as a single unit of accounting, we\\ngenerally recognize revenues over the contractual period of the arrangement or in the case of our cloud offerings, we generally recognize revenues over the contractual term of the cloud software subscription. For the purposes of revenue\\nclassification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we allocate revenue to the respective revenue line items within our consolidated statements of operations based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing\\nour best estimate of relative selling prices of such elements.  For our nonsoftware multiple-element arrangements, we allocate revenue to each\\nelement based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangement\\x92s inception. The selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy: VSOE if available, third party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or\\nestimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE are available (a description as to how we determine VSOE, TPE and ESP is provided below). If a tangible hardware systems product includes software, we determine whether the tangible hardware\\nsystems product and the software work together to deliver the product\\x92s essential functionality and, if so, the entire product is treated as a nonsoftware deliverable. The total arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of\\naccounting for each of the nonsoftware deliverables using the relative selling prices of each unit based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. We limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to an amount that is not\\ncontingent upon future delivery of additional products or services or meeting of any specified performance conditions.  When possible, we\\nestablish VSOE of selling price for deliverables in software and nonsoftware multiple-element arrangements using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and for software license updates and product support and hardware systems\\nsupport, based on the renewal rates offered to customers. TPE \\n \\xa0 45 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nis established by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated customers. If we are unable to determine the selling\\nprice because VSOE or TPE does not exist, we determine ESP for the purposes of allocating the arrangement by reviewing historical transactions, including transactions whereby the deliverable was sold on a standalone basis and considering several\\nother external and internal factors including, but not limited to, pricing practices including discounting, margin objectives, competition, contractually stated prices, the geographies in which we offer our products and services, the type of\\ncustomer (i.e., distributor, value added reseller, government agency and direct end user, among others) and the stage of the product lifecycle. The determination of ESP is made through consultation with and approval by our management, taking into\\nconsideration our pricing model and go-to-market strategy. As our, or our competitors\\x92, pricing and go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes to our determination of VSOE,\\nTPE and ESP. As a result, our future revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements could differ materially from our results in the current period. Selling prices are analyzed on an annual basis or more frequently if we experience significant\\nchanges in our selling prices.  Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to both Software and Nonsoftware Elements \\nRevenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements\\x97Arrangements with Software and Nonsoftware Elements \\nWe also enter into multiple-element arrangements that may include a combination of our various software related and nonsoftware related products and\\nservices offerings including new software licenses, software license updates and product support, cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, hardware systems products, hardware systems support, consulting, advanced customer support services and education.\\nIn such arrangements, we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative selling prices of the software group of elements as a whole and to the nonsoftware elements. We then further allocate consideration within the software\\ngroup to the respective elements within that group following the guidance in ASC 985-605 and our policies as described above. After the arrangement consideration has been allocated to the elements, we account for each respective element in the\\narrangement as described above.  Other Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to Software and Nonsoftware Elements \\nMany of our software arrangements include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts and are included as a\\npart of our services business. Consulting revenues from these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from new software licenses revenues because the arrangements qualify as services transactions as defined in ASC 985-605. The more\\nsignificant factors considered in determining whether the revenues should be accounted for separately include the nature of services (i.e., consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product), degree of\\nrisk, availability of services from other vendors, timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee. Revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are\\nperformed. If there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services, revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved. We estimate the proportional performance on\\ncontracts with fixed or \\x93not to exceed\\x94 fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project. If we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion,\\nrevenues are recognized when we receive final acceptance from the customer that the services have been completed. When total cost estimates exceed revenues, we accrue for the estimated losses immediately using cost estimates that are based upon an\\naverage fully burdened daily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the services. The complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the\\nproportional performance method of accounting affects the amounts of revenues and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements. A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates, including labor rates,\\nutilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes.  Our advanced customer support services are offered as\\nstandalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying other software and non-software products and services. We offer these advanced support \\n \\xa0 46 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nservices, both on-premises and remote, to Oracle customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their products and services. Depending upon the nature of the arrangement,\\nrevenues from these services are recognized as the services are performed or ratably over the term of the service period, which is generally one year or less.  Education revenues are also a part of our services business and include instructor-led, media-based and internet-based training in the use of our software and hardware products. Education revenues are\\nrecognized as the classes or other education offerings are delivered.  If an arrangement contains multiple elements and does not qualify for\\nseparate accounting for the product and service transactions, then new software licenses revenues and/or hardware systems products revenues, including the costs of hardware systems products, are generally recognized together with the services based\\non contract accounting using either the percentage-of-completion or completed-contract method. Contract accounting is applied to any bundled software and cloud, hardware systems and services arrangements: (1)\\xa0that include milestones or customer\\nspecific acceptance criteria that may affect collection of the software license or hardware systems product fees; (2)\\xa0where consulting services include significant modification or customization of the software or hardware systems product or are\\nof a specialized nature and generally performed only by Oracle; (3)\\xa0where significant consulting services are provided for in the software license contract or hardware systems product contract without additional charge or are substantially\\ndiscounted; or (4)\\xa0where the software license or hardware systems product payment is tied to the performance of consulting services. For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of\\naccounting, we allocate revenues to software and nonsoftware elements based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of the relative selling price of such elements.  We also evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing \\x93fiscal funding\\x94 or \\x93termination for convenience\\x94 provisions, when such provisions are required by law, to determine\\nthe probability of possible cancellation. We consider multiple factors, including the history with the customer in similar transactions, the \\x93essential use\\x94 of the software or hardware systems products and the planning, budgeting and\\napproval processes undertaken by the governmental entity. If we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is remote, we then recognize revenues once all of the criteria described above have been met. If such\\na determination cannot be made, revenues are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity.  We assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenues if all other revenue recognition requirements are met. Our standard payment terms are net 30 days. However,\\npayment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed. Payments that are due within six months are generally deemed to be fixed or determinable based on our successful collection history on such arrangements, and thereby\\nsatisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition.  While most of our arrangements for sales within our businesses include short-term\\npayment terms, we have a standard practice of providing long-term financing to creditworthy customers primarily through our financing division. Since fiscal 1989, when our financing division was formed, we have established a history of collection,\\nwithout concessions, on these receivables with payment terms that generally extend up to five years from the contract date. Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, we recognize new software licenses revenues and hardware\\nsystems products revenues for these arrangements upon delivery, net of any payment discounts from financing transactions. We have generally sold receivables financed through our financing division on a non-recourse basis to third party financing\\ninstitutions within 90 days of the contracts\\x92 dates of execution and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We account for the sales of these receivables\\nas \\x93true sales\\x94 as defined in ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing, as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables.  In addition, we enter into arrangements with leasing companies for the sale of our hardware systems products. These leasing companies, in turn, lease our products to end-users. The leasing companies\\ngenerally have no recourse to us in the event of default by the end-user and we recognize revenue upon delivery, if all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. \\n \\xa0 47 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Our customers include several of our suppliers and, occasionally, we have purchased goods or services for\\nour operations from these vendors at or about the same time that we have sold our products to these same companies (Concurrent Transactions). Software license agreements or sales of hardware systems that occur within a three-month time period from\\nthe date we have purchased goods or services from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure. When we acquire goods or services from a customer, we negotiate the purchase separately from any sales\\ntransaction, at terms we consider to be at arm\\x92s length and settle the purchase in cash. We recognize revenues from Concurrent Transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are met and the goods and services acquired are necessary for\\nour current operations.  Business Combinations  We apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, in the accounting for our acquisitions. It requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities\\nassumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use\\nour best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a\\nresult, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement\\nperiod or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. \\nAccounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, including\\nour estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, restructuring liabilities, pre-acquisition contingencies and contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past\\nhave been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.  Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include but are not limited to:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n future expected cash flows from software license sales, cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS contracts, hardware systems product sales, support agreements,\\nconsulting contracts, other customer contracts, acquired developed technologies and patents;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when\\ncompleted;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the acquired company\\x92s brand and competitive position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used\\nin the combined company\\x92s product portfolio; and  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n discount rates. \\nUnanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. \\nWe estimate the fair values of our cloud SaaS and PaaS (collectively, cloud software subscriptions), software license updates and product support, and\\nhardware systems support obligations assumed. The estimated fair values of these performance obligations are determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to\\nfulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. The estimated costs to fulfill the obligations are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services including the correction of any errors in the products acquired. The\\nsum of these costs and operating profit approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the performance obligations. We do not include any costs associated with selling efforts or research and development\\nor the related fulfillment margins on these costs. Profit associated with any selling efforts is excluded because the \\n \\xa0 48 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nacquired entities would have concluded those selling efforts on the performance obligations prior to the acquisition date. We also do not include the estimated research and development costs in\\nour fair value determinations, as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition. As a result, we did not recognize cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues related to cloud SaaS and PaaS contracts in the amounts of $12\\nmillion, $17 million and $45 million that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues\\nrelated to support contracts in the amounts of $11 million, $3 million and $14 million that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In addition, we did not\\nrecognize hardware systems support revenues related to hardware systems support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $4 million, $11 million and $14 million for fiscal\\n2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Historically, substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software license updates and product support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal and we\\nstrive to renew cloud SaaS and PaaS, and hardware systems support contracts. To the extent cloud SaaS and PaaS, software support or hardware systems support contracts are renewed, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of the contracts\\nover their respective contractual periods, which are generally one year in duration.  In connection with a business combination or other\\nstrategic initiative, we may estimate costs associated with restructuring plans committed to by our management. Restructuring costs are typically comprised of employee severance costs, costs of consolidating duplicate facilities and contract\\ntermination costs. Restructuring expenses are based upon plans that have been committed to by our management, but may be refined in subsequent periods. We account for costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company separately\\nfrom the business combination pursuant to ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations. A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations\\nin the period in which the liability is incurred. When estimating the fair value of facility restructuring activities, assumptions are applied regarding estimated sub-lease payments to be received, which can differ materially from actual results.\\nThis may require us to revise our initial estimates which may materially affect our results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made.  For a given acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the\\nmeasurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts.\\n If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a pre-acquisition contingency (non-income tax related) by the end of the measurement\\nperiod, which is generally the case given the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (i)\\xa0it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the\\nacquisition date and (ii)\\xa0the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent to the measurement period, changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our\\nresults of operations and financial position.  In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection\\nwith a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being\\nrecorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance\\x92s or contingency\\x92s estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain\\ntax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. \\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\\x97Impairment Assessments   We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles\\x97Goodwill and\\nOther. According to ASC 350, we can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting unit\\x92s goodwill for \\n \\xa0 49 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nimpairment or we can directly perform the two step impairment test. Based on our qualitative assessment, if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e., a\\nlikelihood of more than 50 percent) to be less than its carrying amount, the two step impairment test prescribed by ASC 350 will be performed. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair\\nvalue of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting\\nunit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit\\x92s goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit\\x92s\\ngoodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference.  Determining the fair value of a\\nreporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic\\nand market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. In\\naddition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units.  Based upon our most recent annual goodwill impairment review which took place as of March\\xa01, 2015, we recorded a goodwill impairment loss related to our hardware systems products reporting unit. We\\nconsidered several approaches to determine the fair value of our hardware systems reporting unit and concluded the most appropriate to be the income approach. Based upon the completion of our annual forecasting process, the fair value of our\\nhardware systems products reporting unit under the income approach was impacted by lower forecasted operating results, primarily caused by lower forecasted revenues and our continued investment in research and development activities. We compared the\\nimplied fair value of goodwill in our hardware systems products reporting unit to its carrying value, which resulted in a $186 million goodwill impairment loss, representing the aggregate amount of goodwill in our hardware systems products reporting\\nunit. The aggregate hardware systems reporting unit goodwill that was impaired in fiscal 2015 resulted from our acquisitions of Pillar Data Systems, Inc., Xsigo Systems, Inc., GreenBytes, Inc. and MICROS Systems, Inc. Such impairment loss was\\nrecorded to acquisition related and other expenses in our fiscal 2015 consolidated statement of operations. We did not recognize any goodwill impairment losses in fiscal 2014 or 2013.  Our most recent annual goodwill impairment review for our other reporting units, which also took place on March\\xa01, 2015, did not result in a goodwill impairment loss. Other than our consulting\\nreporting unit, all of our other reporting units had fair values that substantially exceeded their carrying values. Our consulting reporting unit had $1.8 billion of goodwill on March\\xa01, 2015, and experienced revenue and operating margin\\ndeclines in fiscal 2015. As of our most recent annual goodwill impairment review, our consulting reporting unit\\x92s fair value was 16% in excess of its carrying value. We estimate that should our consulting reporting unit\\x92s projected margins\\nand related cash flows unfavorably deviate from our projections by 20% or more, our consulting reporting unit likely would incur a goodwill impairment loss.  We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Each period we evaluate the\\nestimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. Recoverability of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of\\nthe carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. We review indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying\\nvalue may not be recoverable. Recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured\\nas the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset.  Assumptions and estimates about future values and\\nremaining useful lives of our intangible and other long-lived assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in\\nour business strategy and our internal \\n \\xa0 50 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nforecasts. Although we believe the historical assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported\\nfinancial results. We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2015, 2014 or 2013.  Accounting for Income\\nTaxes  Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business,\\nthere are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities, the process of identifying\\nitems of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment and segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of these\\nmatters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made.\\n Our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such\\nearnings are planned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Remittances of foreign earnings to the United States are planned based on projected cash flow, working capital and investment needs of our foreign and domestic operations.\\nBased on these assumptions, we estimate the amount that will be distributed to the United States and provide U.S. federal taxes on these amounts. Material changes in our estimates as to how much of our foreign earnings will be distributed to the\\nUnited States or tax legislation that limits or restricts the amount of undistributed foreign earnings that we consider indefinitely reinvested outside the United States could materially impact our income tax provision and effective tax rate.\\n We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In order for us\\nto realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We consider future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in\\nthe jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we\\nwere to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a\\ndetermination, or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period. If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would\\nbe realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to earnings at such time. \\nWe calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax\\nreturns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known, which can materially impact our effective tax rate.\\n The amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed\\nassessments. Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. A description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under\\n\\x93Business Combinations\\x94 above. For those tax related contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we account for these uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740, Income Taxes, which contains a two-step approach to\\nrecognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in\\nan audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although we believe we have\\nadequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a\\ntax audit, judicial rulings, and refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from \\n \\xa0 51 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nour estimates. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences generally will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in\\nwhich such a determination is made. Our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties. \\nIn addition, as a part of our accounting for business combinations, intangible assets are recognized at fair values and goodwill is measured as the excess\\nof consideration transferred over the net estimated fair values of assets acquired. Impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period that any\\nimpairment is recorded. Amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible pursuant to our existing tax structure; however, deferred taxes have been recorded for non-deductible amortization expenses as\\na part of the accounting for business combinations. We have taken into account the allocation of these identified intangibles among different taxing jurisdictions, including those with nominal or zero percent tax rates, in establishing the related\\ndeferred tax liabilities.  Legal and Other Contingencies  We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. A description of our accounting\\npolicies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under \\x93Business Combinations\\x94 above. For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we accrue a liability for\\nan estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to\\nwhether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time the accruals are made. As additional information becomes available,\\nwe reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial\\nposition.  Stock-Based Compensation  We account for share-based payments to employees, including grants of service-based employee stock options, service-based restricted stock awards, performance-based restricted stock awards (PSUs) and\\npurchases under employee stock purchase plans, in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation\\x97Stock Compensation, which requires that share-based payments (to the extent they are compensatory) be recognized in our consolidated statements of\\noperations based on their fair values and the estimated number of shares we ultimately expect will vest. For our service-based awards, we recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period of the award, which\\nis generally four years. For our PSUs, we recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period for each separately vesting tranche, as the performance conditions to evaluate attainment of each tranche for each\\nparticipant are independent of the performance conditions for the other tranches.  We are required to estimate the stock awards that we\\nultimately expect to vest and to reduce stock-based compensation expense for the effects of estimated forfeitures of awards over the expense recognition period. Although we estimate the rate of future forfeitures based upon historical experience,\\nactual forfeitures in the future may differ. To the extent our actual forfeitures are different than our estimates, we record a true-up for the difference in the period that a grantee terminates or the awards vest and such true-ups could materially\\naffect our operating results. Additionally, we also consider on a quarterly basis whether there have been any significant changes in facts and circumstances that would affect our expected forfeiture rate. \\nWe estimate the fair values of employee stock options using a Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. The fair value of an award is affected by our stock\\nprice on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options. The risk-free interest\\nrate assumption we use is based upon U.S. treasury interest rates appropriate for the expected life of the awards. We use the implied volatility of publicly traded \\n \\xa0 52 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\noptions in our stock in order to estimate future stock price trends as we believe that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. In order\\nto determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options, we have used historical rates of employee groups by seniority of job classification. Our expected dividend rate is based upon an annualized dividend\\nyield based on the per share dividend declared by our Board of Directors. The aforementioned inputs entered into the option valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective estimates and changes to these estimates will cause the\\nfair values of our stock awards and related stock-based compensation expense that we record to vary.  We issue PSUs to certain key executives.\\nWe estimate the fair values of the PSUs based upon their intrinsic values as of the grant dates as the vesting conditions and related terms of the PSUs were communicated to each participating employee as of their respective grant dates and include\\nattainment metrics that are defined, fixed and consistently determined based upon consistent U.S. GAAP metrics or internal metrics and that require the employee to render service. The performance conditions of the PSUs affect the number of PSUs that\\nwill ultimately vest and be issued to the grantee based upon a \\x93target\\x94 that is subject to certain attainment maximums, with the possibility that none will vest if applicable performance conditions are not met. We update the amount of\\nstock-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, to record as of the end of each reporting period based on the expected attainment of performance targets, which is subject to change until a final determination is known. Changes to the target\\nestimates are reflected in the amount of stock-based compensation expense that we recognize for each PSU tranche on a cumulative basis during the reporting period in which the target estimates are altered and may cause the amount of stock-based\\ncompensation expense that we record for such reporting period to vary.  We record deferred tax assets for stock-based compensation awards that\\nresult in deductions on our income tax returns, based on the amount of stock-based compensation recognized and the fair values attributable to the vested portion of stock awards assumed in connection with a business combination, at the statutory tax\\nrate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a tax deduction. Because the deferred tax assets we record are based upon the stock-based compensation expenses in a particular jurisdiction, the aforementioned inputs that affect the fair values of\\nour stock awards may also indirectly affect our income tax expense. In addition, differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on our income tax returns are recorded in\\nadditional paid-in capital.  To the extent we change the terms of our employee stock-based compensation programs, experience market volatility\\nin the pricing of our common stock that increases the implied volatility calculation of publicly traded options in our stock, refine different assumptions in future periods such as forfeiture rates or PSU target performance attainment that differ\\nfrom our current estimates, or assume stock awards from acquired companies that are different in nature than our stock award arrangements, among other potential impacts, the stock-based compensation expense that we record in future periods and the\\ntax benefits that we realize may differ significantly from what we have recorded in previous reporting periods.  Results of Operations\\n Impact of Acquisitions  The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was impacted by our acquisitions, primarily our acquisitions of MICROS in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 and Responsys\\nin the third quarter of fiscal 2014.  The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was impacted by our\\nacquisitions, primarily our acquisitions of Responsys in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, Tekelec in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and Acme Packet in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.  In our discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013, we may qualitatively disclose the impact of our acquired\\nproducts and services (for the one year period subsequent to the acquisition date) to the growth in certain of our operating segments\\x92 revenues where such qualitative discussions would be meaningful for an understanding of the factors that\\ninfluenced the changes in our results of operations. When material, we may also provide quantitative disclosures related to such \\n \\xa0 53 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nacquired products and services. The contributions of our acquisitions to certain of our operating segments\\x92 revenues, margins and expenses for each of the respective period comparisons\\ngenerally are not provided in our discussions, as they either were not separately identifiable due to the integration of these businesses and operating segments into our existing operations, and/or were insignificant to our results of operations\\nduring the periods presented.  We caution readers that, while pre- and post-acquisition comparisons, as well as any quantified amounts\\nthemselves, may provide indications of general trends, any acquisition information that we provide has inherent limitations for the following reasons:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n any qualitative and quantitative disclosures cannot specifically address or quantify the substantial effects attributable to changes in business\\nstrategies, including our sales force integration efforts. We believe that if our acquired companies had operated independently and sales forces had not been integrated, the relative mix of products sold would have been different; and\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n although substantially all of our software license customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software license updates and\\nproduct support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal and we strive to renew cloud SaaS and PaaS contracts and hardware systems support contracts, the amounts shown as cloud SaaS and PaaS deferred revenues, software license updates\\nand product support deferred revenues, and hardware systems support deferred revenues in our supplemental disclosure related to certain charges (presented below) are not necessarily indicative of revenue improvements we will achieve upon contract\\nrenewals to the extent customers do not renew.  Constant Currency Presentation \\nOur international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues and expenses. As a result, total\\nrevenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S.\\xa0Dollar against major international currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign\\ncurrency fluctuations, we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Annual Report using constant currency disclosure. To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities\\nreporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e., the rates in effect on May\\xa031, 2014, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year) rather than the actual exchange rates in\\neffect during the respective periods. For example, if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0\\xa0million Euros from products sold on May\\xa031, 2015 and 2014, our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of $1.08 million in\\nfiscal 2015 (using 1.08 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period) and $1.36 million in fiscal 2014 (using 1.36 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period). The constant currency presentation, however, would translate the\\nfiscal 2015 results using the fiscal 2014 exchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during the period. In each of the tables below, we present the percent change based on actual, unrounded results in reported currency and in\\nconstant currency. \\n \\xa0 54 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n

of operations for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 were\\nsignificantly impacted by movements in international currencies relative to the U.S.\\xa0Dollar, which decreased our total revenues by 4 percentage points, total operating expenses by 3 percentage points and total operating income by 6 percentage\\npoints.  Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency variations of 4 percentage points, our total revenues increased in fiscal 2015 due to\\nrevenue increases in our software and cloud and hardware systems businesses. The constant currency growth in our software and cloud revenues was attributable to growth in our software license updates and product support revenues, growth in our SaaS,\\nPaaS and IaaS revenues, and revenue contributions from our recent acquisitions. The constant currency growth in our hardware systems business was attributable to growth in our hardware systems support revenues, which were primarily attributable to\\nrevenue contributions from our recent acquisitions. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 69%, EMEA contributed 28% and Asia Pacific contributed 3% to the growth in our total revenues during fiscal 2015.\\n Excluding the effects of favorable currency variations of 3 percentage points, our total operating expenses increased during fiscal 2015 due\\nto expense increases across all of our lines of business, the largest of which were due to increased sales and marketing and research and development expenses resulting primarily from increased headcount, increased cloud SaaS and PaaS expenses to\\nsupport the increase in our cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues, and increased acquisition related and other expenses.  Excluding the effects of\\nunfavorable foreign currency rate fluctuations of 6 percentage points, our fiscal 2015 operating margin was flat in comparison to the prior year, while our operating margin as a percentage of revenues decreased during fiscal 2015 as our total\\noperating expenses increased at a faster rate than our total revenues.  Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal\\n2013:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0On a constant currency basis, our total revenues increased in fiscal 2014 due to increases in our software and cloud business revenues and our hardware systems business revenues, partially offset by a\\ndecrease in our services business revenues. The constant currency revenue growth in our \\n \\xa0 55 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nsoftware and cloud business was substantially attributable to growth in our software license updates and product support revenues and, to a lesser extent, growth in our cloud SaaS and PaaS\\nrevenues due to incremental revenues from our acquisitions. The constant currency revenue growth in our hardware business was due to an increase in our hardware systems support revenues due substantially to incremental revenues from our acquisitions\\nand due to increases in our hardware revenues attributable to our Oracle Engineered Systems. On a constant currency basis, the Americas contributed 61%, EMEA contributed 30% and Asia Pacific contributed 9% to our total revenues growth during fiscal\\n2014.  Total constant currency operating expenses increased during fiscal 2014 primarily due to an increase in sales and marketing and research\\nand development expenses resulting from increased headcount, increased sales-based variable compensation expenses due to revenues growth, and increased cloud SaaS and PaaS expenses to support the increase in our cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues. These\\nexpense increases in fiscal 2014 were partially offset by lower constant currency expenses in fiscal 2014 from our hardware systems support and services segments due to decreased headcount, lower restructuring expenses, and lower intangible assets\\namortization. In fiscal 2013, we recognized a $387 million acquisition related benefit related to changes in estimates for contingent consideration payable (refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this\\nAnnual Report for additional information) and a $306 million benefit relating to certain litigation (refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information), both of which\\ndecreased our acquisition related and other expenses during this period.  Excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, our\\noperating margin increased during fiscal 2014 due to our revenues growth, while our operating margin as a percentage of revenues was flat. \\nSupplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges  To supplement our consolidated financial information, we believe the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future. You should\\nreview the introduction under \\x93Impact of Acquisitions\\x94 (above) for a discussion of the inherent limitations in comparing pre- and post-acquisition information.

operations \\nFiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations of 5 percentage\\npoints, total new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues remained flat during fiscal 2015 as growth in our cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues and contributions from our recent acquisitions were offset by a decline in our new software\\nlicenses revenues. In constant currency, fiscal 2015 revenue growth in the Americas region was offset by revenue declines in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions.  As a result of our acquisitions, we recorded adjustments to reduce assumed cloud SaaS and PaaS obligations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. Due to our application of business\\ncombination accounting rules, cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues in the amounts of $12 million, $17 million and $45 million that would have \\n \\xa0 58 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nbeen otherwise recorded by our acquired businesses as independent entities were not recognized in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. To the extent underlying cloud SaaS and PaaS contracts\\nare renewed with us following an acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of the cloud SaaS and PaaS contracts over the respective contractual periods.  In reported currency, new software licenses revenues earned from transactions of $3 million or greater decreased by 15% in fiscal 2015 and represented 31% of our new software licenses revenues in fiscal\\n2015 in comparison to 33% in fiscal 2014.  Excluding the effects of favorable currency rate fluctuations of 4 percentage points, total new\\nsoftware licenses and cloud software subscriptions expenses increased in fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher employee related expenses from increased headcount, higher variable compensation expenses, and higher cloud SaaS and PaaS expenses incurred\\nto support the related revenues increase.  Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations, total new software licenses and\\ncloud software subscriptions margin and margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2015 due to the growth in total expenses for this operating segment.  Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations, total new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions\\nrevenues increased during fiscal 2014 primarily due to incremental revenues from our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings resulting from our recent acquisitions. In constant currency, total new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues\\ngrowth in fiscal 2014 in the Americas and EMEA region was partially offset by a decline in revenues in the Asia Pacific region.  As described\\nabove, the amount of new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues that we recognized in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 were affected by business combination accounting rules. In reported currency, new software licenses revenues\\nearned from transactions of $3 million or greater increased by 3% in fiscal 2014 and represented 33% of our new software licenses revenues in fiscal 2014 in comparison to 32% in fiscal 2013.  Excluding the effects of favorable currency rate fluctuations, total new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions expenses increased in fiscal 2014 primarily due to higher employee related\\nexpenses from increased headcount, higher variable compensation expenses due to revenues growth, and higher cloud SaaS and PaaS expenses incurred to support the related revenues increase.  Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations, total new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions margin and margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2014 as our\\ntotal expenses increased at a faster rate than our total revenues for this operating segment.  Cloud Infrastructure as a\\nService:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our cloud infrastructure as a service segment provides comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services for customer IT infrastructure for a fee for a stated term that is hosted at our\\nOracle data center facilities, select partner data centers or physically on-premises at customer facilities; virtual machine instance services that are subscription-based in which we deploy, secure, provision, manage and maintain certain of our\\nhardware products for our customers to provide them with a set of cloud-based core infrastructure capabilities like elastic compute and storage services to run workloads in the cloud; and hardware and related support offerings for certain of our\\nOracle Engineered Systems that are deployed in our customers\\x92 data centers for a monthly fee. Cloud infrastructure as a service expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenditures, technology infrastructure expenditures and facilities\\ncosts. For all periods presented, our cloud-infrastructure as a service segment\\x92s revenues and expenses were substantially attributable to our comprehensive software and hardware management, maintenance and hosting services. \\n \\xa0 59 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of

operations \\nFiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency variations of 4\\npercentage points, software license updates and product support revenues increased by 8% in fiscal 2015 as a result of new software licenses sold with substantially all of these customers electing to purchase software support contracts during the\\ntrailing 4-quarter period, the renewal of substantially all of the software support customer base eligible for renewal during the trailing 4-quarter period and incremental revenues from our recent acquisitions. Excluding the effects of currency rate\\nfluctuations, the Americas contributed 50%, EMEA contributed 36% and Asia Pacific contributed 14% to the increase in software license updates and product support revenues during fiscal 2015.  As a result of our acquisitions, we recorded adjustments to reduce assumed software support obligations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. Due to our application of business\\ncombination accounting rules, software license updates and product support revenues related to software support contracts in the amounts of $11 million, $3 million and $14 million that would have been otherwise recorded by our acquired businesses as\\nindependent entities were not recognized in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Historically, substantially all of our software license customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software support contracts when such\\ncontracts are eligible for renewal. To the extent these underlying support contracts are renewed, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of these contracts over the support periods, the substantial majority of which are one year in\\nduration. \\n \\xa0 61 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Excluding the effects of favorable foreign currency rate fluctuations, total software license updates and\\nproduct support expenses increased during fiscal 2015 due to higher employee related expenses and facilities costs associated with increased headcount that was primarily attributable to our recent acquisitions, and also increased due to higher bad\\ndebt expenses. These fiscal 2015 expense increases were partially offset by fiscal 2015 expense decreases related to lower statutory obligation expenses in the jurisdictions in which we operate and lower amortization of intangible assets.\\n In constant currency, total margin and margin as a percentage of revenues for this segment increased during fiscal 2015 as our total revenues\\nfor this segment increased at a faster rate than our total expenses for this segment, each during fiscal 2015 and in comparison to fiscal 2014. \\nFiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations, software\\nlicense updates and product support revenues increased in fiscal 2014 for reasons similar to those noted above for our fiscal 2015 revenues increase. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas\\ncontributed 55%, EMEA contributed 30% and Asia Pacific contributed 15% to the increase in software license updates and product support revenues during fiscal 2014.  As described above, the amounts of software license updates and product support revenues that we recognized in fiscal 2014 and 2013 were affected by business combination accounting rules. \\nExcluding the effects of favorable foreign currency rate fluctuations, total software license updates and product support expenses during fiscal 2014\\ndecreased slightly due to a modest decrease in headcount and a decrease in amortization of intangible assets. Total margin and total margin as a percentage of revenues increased during fiscal 2014 as our total revenues for this segment increased\\nwhile our total expenses slightly decreased, each during fiscal 2014 and in comparison to fiscal 2013.  Hardware Systems Business\\n Our hardware systems business consists of our hardware systems products segment and hardware systems support segment. \\nHardware Systems Products:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Hardware systems products revenues are primarily generated from the sales of our Oracle\\nEngineered Systems, computer server, storage, networking, workstations and related devices and industry specific hardware products. We market and sell our hardware systems products through our direct sales force and indirect channels such as\\nindependent distributors and value added resellers. Operating expenses associated with our hardware systems products include the cost of hardware systems products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by\\nour internal manufacturing operations or by third party manufacturers, warranty expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the impact of inventory determined to be excess and obsolete. Operating expenses associated\\nwith our hardware systems products also include sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include variable compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of our hardware products, and amortization of intangible\\nassets. \\n \\xa0 62 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of

Excluding the effects of favorable currency rate fluctuations of 5 percentage points, total hardware systems products expenses\\ndecreased in fiscal 2015 primarily due to lower bad debt expenses and a reduction in amortization of intangible assets. These fiscal 2015 expense decreases were partially offset by higher fiscal 2015 employee related expenses due to increased\\nheadcount from our recent acquisitions and higher direct product costs that were primarily attributable to higher revenues from recently acquired companies.

The Americas region contributed 42%, EMEA contributed 52% and Asia Pacific contributed\\n6%, to our constant currency growth in hardware systems support revenues during fiscal 2015.  As a result of our acquisitions, we\\nrecorded adjustments to reduce assumed hardware systems support obligations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, hardware systems support revenues related to\\nhardware systems support contracts in the amounts of $4 million, $11 million and $14 million were not recognized in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. To the extent these underlying hardware systems support contracts are renewed, we will\\nrecognize the revenues for the full values of these contracts over the future support periods.  In constant currency, total hardware systems\\nsupport expenses decreased in fiscal 2015 primarily due to reduced service delivery costs due to operational initiatives and a decrease in amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by higher employee related expenses resulting from\\nincreased headcount from our recent acquisitions, higher external contractor expenses and higher bad debt expenses.

Services Business  Our services business consists of consulting, advanced customer support\\nservices and education services. Consulting revenues are earned by providing services to customers in business and IT strategy alignment, enterprise architecture planning and design, initial product implementation and integration, and ongoing\\nproduct enhancements and upgrades. Advanced customer support services are provided on-premises and remotely to our customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their Oracle products and services. Education revenues are earned\\nby providing instructor-led, live virtual training, self-paced online training, private events and custom training in the use of our software and hardware offerings. The cost of providing our services consists primarily of personnel related\\nexpenses, technology infrastructure expenditures, facilities expenses and external contractor expenses.

percentage points, our total services revenues were flat in fiscal 2015 as incremental revenues from our recently acquired companies, including MICROS, and an increase in fiscal 2015 advanced customer\\nservices revenues were offset by declines in our fiscal 2015 consulting and education revenues. In constant currency, revenues growth in the EMEA region was offset by revenue declines in the Americas region and Asia Pacific region during fiscal\\n2015.  Excluding the effects of favorable currency rate fluctuations of 5 percentage points, our total services expenses increased during\\nfiscal 2015 due to higher employee related expenses resulting from increased headcount from our recent acquisitions and were partially offset by lower variable compensation and lower external contractor costs, each in comparison to fiscal 2014.\\n In constant currency, total margin and margin as a percentage of total revenues decreased during fiscal 2015 due to the increase in total\\nexpenses for this business.  Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Excluding the effects of currency rate\\nfluctuations, our total services revenues decreased in fiscal 2014 due to revenue decreases in each of our services business\\x92 segments.

Provision for Income Taxes:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our effective tax rate in all periods is the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of\\nincome tax rates. The provision for income taxes differs from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to earnings considered as indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations, state taxes, the U.S. research and\\ndevelopment tax credit and the U.S. domestic production activity deduction. Future effective tax rates could be adversely affected if earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates, by unfavorable changes in\\ntax laws and regulations or by adverse rulings in tax related litigation.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nYear Ended May\\xa031,\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nPercent Change\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nPercent Change\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n (Dollars in millions)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2015\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nActual\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nConstant\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2014\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nActual\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nConstant\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2013\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Provision for income taxes\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02,896\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n5%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n13%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02,749\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n-7%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n-6%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02,973\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Effective tax rate\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n22.6%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n20.1%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n21.4%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Provision for income taxes in fiscal 2015\\nincreased, relative to the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2014, due in substantial part to an unfavorable change in the jurisdictional mix of our fiscal 2015 earnings, and due to the effects of acquisition related settlements with tax\\nauthorities in fiscal 2014 that were not present in fiscal 2015, which together were partially offset by lower fiscal 2015 income before provision for income taxes.

These working capital increases were partially offset by $6.2 billion of net cash used for our acquisitions of MICROS and others, $8.1 billion of cash used for repurchases of our common stock, the\\nreclassification of $2.0 billion of senior notes due January 2016 from long-term to current, and $2.3 billion of cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders, all of which occurred during fiscal 2015. Our working capital may be impacted by some or\\nall of the aforementioned factors in future periods, the amounts and timing of which are variable.  The increase in working capital as of\\nMay\\xa031, 2014 in comparison to May\\xa031, 2013 was primarily due to our issuance of \\x802.0 billion and $3.0 billion of long-term senior notes in July 2013, the favorable impact to our net current assets resulting from our net income during\\nfiscal 2014, and, to a lesser extent, cash proceeds from stock option exercises. These working capital increases were partially offset by the reclassification of $1.5 billion of senior notes due July 2014 from long-term to current, $9.8 billion of\\ncash used for repurchases of our common stock, cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders, and cash used for acquisitions.  Cash,\\ncash equivalents and marketable securities:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper and other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less.\\nMarketable securities primarily consist of time deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper, corporate notes and certain other securities. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May\\xa031, 2015 in comparison\\nto May\\xa031, 2014 was due to an increase in cash generated from our operating activities, our issuance of $20.0 billion of senior notes in fiscal 2015, and to a lesser extent, cash proceeds from stock option exercises. These increases were\\npartially offset by $6.2 billion of net cash paid for our acquisitions of MICROS and others, $8.1 billion of repurchases of our common stock, the repayment of $1.5 billion of senior notes and $2.3 billion used for the payment of cash dividends to\\nour stockholders. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities included $42.7 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries as of May\\xa031, 2015. We consider $38.0 billion of our undistributed earnings as indefinitely reinvested in our foreign\\noperations outside the United States. These undistributed earnings would be subject to U.S. income tax if repatriated to the United States. Assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits, the potential deferred tax liability associated with\\nthese undistributed earnings would be approximately $11.8 billion as of May\\xa031, 2015 should the amounts be repatriated to the United States. The amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a\\nsignificant portion of the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances held by our foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective\\nreporting period (the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere\\nin this Annual Report). As the U.S.\\xa0Dollar generally strengthened against certain major international currencies during fiscal 2015, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for these\\nsubsidiaries decreased on a net basis as of May\\xa031, 2015 relative to what we would have reported using constant currency rates from our May\\xa031, 2014 balance sheet date.  The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May\\xa031, 2014 in comparison to May\\xa031, 2013 was due to an increase in cash generated from our operating activities, our\\nissuance of \\x802.0 billion and $3.0 billion of senior notes in July 2013, and to a lesser extent, cash proceeds from stock option exercises. These increases were partially offset by $9.8 billion of repurchases of our common stock, $3.5 billion of\\nnet cash paid for acquisitions and $2.2 billion used for the payment of cash dividends to our stockholders. Additionally, our reported cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of May\\xa031, 2014 decreased on a net basis in\\ncomparison to May\\xa031, 2013 due to the modest strengthening of the U.S.\\xa0Dollar in comparison to certain major international currencies during fiscal 2014. \\n \\xa0 70 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Days sales outstanding, which we calculate by dividing period end accounts receivable by average daily sales\\nfor the quarter, was 47 days at May\\xa031, 2015 compared with 48 days at May\\xa031, 2014.

Payments from customers for these support agreements are generally received near the beginning of the\\ncontracts\\x92 terms, which are generally one year in length. Over the course of a fiscal year, we also have historically generated cash from the sales of new software licenses, cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings, hardware systems products, hardware\\nsystems support arrangements, and services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee related expenditures, material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware systems products, taxes and leased\\nfacilities.  Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Net cash provided by operating activities decreased in fiscal\\n2015 in comparison to fiscal 2014 primarily due to the cash unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange rate variances on our fiscal 2015 net income of 7 percentage points.  Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Net cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal 2014 in comparison to fiscal 2013 primarily due to the following: the\\nfiscal 2013 non-recurring impacts of a $387 million reduction of contingent consideration payable in connection with an acquisition (refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for\\nadditional information) and the impact of a $306 million non-current receivable related to certain litigation (refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information), both\\nof which increased our net income in fiscal 2013 without the corresponding operating cash flow benefits. These items did not recur during fiscal 2014.  Cash flows from investing activities:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to acquisitions and the timing of purchases, maturities and\\nsales of our investments in marketable debt securities. We also use cash to invest in capital and other assets, including certain intangible assets, to support our growth.  Net cash used for investing activities increased in fiscal 2015 and 2014, each relative to the respective prior year period, primarily due to an increase in cash used for acquisitions, net of cash\\nacquired, and an increase in net cash used to purchase marketable securities (net of proceeds received from sales and maturities).  Cash\\nflows from financing activities:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and repayments related to our debt instruments as well as stock repurchases, dividend payments and\\nproceeds from stock option exercises.  Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Net cash provided by financing\\nactivities in fiscal 2015 increased in comparison to net cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2014 primarily due to a net increase in borrowings in fiscal 2015 (we issued $20.0 billion of senior notes during fiscal 2015 in comparison to\\n\\x802.0 billion and $3.0 billion of senior notes during fiscal 2014) as well as lower stock repurchase activity during fiscal 2015. These favorable impacts to our financing cash flows during fiscal 2015 were partially offset by the repayment of\\n$1.5 billion of borrowings pursuant to senior notes maturities during fiscal 2015 (no repayments during fiscal 2014).  Fiscal 2014 Compared\\nto Fiscal 2013:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Net cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2014 decreased in comparison to fiscal 2013 primarily due to the repayment of $3.0 billion of borrowings pursuant to senior notes maturities and certain\\nexpired revolving credit facilities in fiscal 2013 (no repayments during fiscal 2014), a net increase in borrowings during fiscal 2014 (we issued \\x802.0 billion and $3.0 billion of senior notes during fiscal\\n\\n \\xa0 71 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\n2014 in comparison to $5.0 billion of senior notes issued during fiscal 2013), lower stock repurchase activity during fiscal 2014 and higher proceeds from stock option exercises during fiscal\\n2014. These fiscal 2014 cash favorable variances were partially offset by an increase in payments of cash dividends to stockholders in fiscal 2014 in comparison to fiscal 2013.  Free cash flow:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to analyze\\ncash flows generated from our operations. We believe free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as\\nan alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We calculate free cash flows as follows: \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nYear Ended May\\xa031,\\n\\xa0\\n\\n (Dollars in millions)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2015\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nChange\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2014\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nChange\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2013\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Net cash provided by operating activities\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa014,336\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n-4%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa014,921\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n5%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa014,224\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Capital expenditures(1)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(1,391\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n140%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(580\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n-11%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(650\\n)\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Free cash flow\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n12,945\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n-10%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n14,341\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n6%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n13,574\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Net income\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n9,938\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n10,955\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n10,925\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Free cash flow as percent of net income\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n130%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n131%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n124%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n(1)\\xa0\\n Derived from capital expenditures as reported in cash flows from investing activities as per our consolidated statements of cash flows presented in\\naccordance with U.S. GAAP.  Long-Term Customer Financing:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We offer certain of our\\ncustomers the option to acquire our software products, hardware systems products and services offerings through separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis\\nto financial institutions within 90 days of the contracts\\x92 dates of execution. We record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financial assets because we are considered to have surrendered control of\\nthese financial assets. We financed $1.6 billion in each of fiscal 2015 and 2014, and $1.8 billion in fiscal 2013, or approximately 19%, 17% and 19%, respectively, of our new software licenses revenues in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013. We financed $172\\nmillion, $168 million and $161 million of our hardware systems products revenues in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, or approximately 6% in each of fiscal 2015 and 2014 and 5% in fiscal 2013 of our hardware systems products revenues.\\n Recent Financing Activities:  Senior Notes:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0As of May\\xa031, 2015, we had $42.0 billion of senior notes outstanding ($24.1 billion outstanding as of May\\xa031, 2014). In fiscal 2015, we issued $20.0\\nbillion of senior notes comprised of $1.0 billion of floating rate notes due July 2017 (2017 Notes), $750 million of floating rate notes due October 2019 (2019 Floating Rate Notes), $2.0 billion of 2.25% notes due October 2019 (2019 Notes), $1.5\\nbillion of 2.80% notes due July 2021 (2021 Notes), $2.5 billion of 2.50% notes due May 2022 (2022 Notes), $2.0 billion of 3.40% notes due July 2024 (2024 Notes), $2.5 billion of 2.95% notes due May 2025 (2025 Notes), $500 million of 3.25% notes due\\nMay 2030 (2030 Notes), $1.75 billion of 4.30% notes due July 2034 (2034 Notes), $1.25 billion of 3.90% notes due May 2035 (2035 Notes), $1.0 billion of 4.50% notes due July 2044 (2044 Notes), $2.0 billion of 4.125% notes due May 2045 (2045 Notes)\\nand $1.25 billion of 4.375% notes due May 2055 (2055 Notes, and together with the 2017 Notes, 2019 Floating Rate Notes, 2019 Notes, 2021 Notes, 2022 Notes, 2024 Notes, 2025 Notes, 2030 Notes, 2034 Notes, 2035 Notes, 2044 Notes and 2045 Notes, the\\nSenior Notes).  We issued the Senior Notes for general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on\\nour common stock, future acquisitions and repayment of indebtedness. Additional details regarding our Senior Notes and related interest rate swap agreements are included in Notes 8 and 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included\\nelsewhere in this Annual Report.  In July 2014, our 3.75% senior notes due July 2014 for $1.5 billion matured and were repaid, and we settled\\nthe fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements associated with such fixed rate senior notes. \\n \\xa0 72 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Interest Rate Swap Agreements:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In July 2014, we entered into certain interest\\nrate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with our 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes so that the interest payable on these notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. As of May\\xa031,\\n2015, our 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes had effective interest rates of 0.76% and 0.91%, respectively, after considering the effects of the aforementioned interest rate swap arrangements. We are accounting for these interest rate swap agreements as fair\\nvalue hedges pursuant to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Additional details regarding our Senior Notes and related interest rate swap agreements are included in Notes 8 and 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere\\nin this Annual Report.  Cash Dividends:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In fiscal 2015, we declared and paid cash dividends of $0.51 per share\\nthat totaled $2.3 billion, an increase of $0.03 per share over the cash dividends declared and paid in fiscal 2014. In June 2015, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share of outstanding common stock payable on\\nJuly\\xa029, 2015 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July\\xa08, 2015. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of\\nDirectors.  Common Stock Repurchases:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares\\nof our common stock. On September\\xa018, 2014, we announced that our Board of Directors approved an expansion of our stock repurchase program by an additional $13.0 billion. As of May\\xa031, 2015, approximately $9.2 billion remained available\\nfor stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program. We repurchased 193.7\\xa0million shares for $8.1 billion, 280.4\\xa0million shares for $9.8 billion, and 346.1\\xa0million shares for $11.0 billion in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013,\\nrespectively. Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our\\ndebt repayment obligations (described further below), our stock price and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase\\nprogram may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.  Contractual Obligations:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The\\ncontractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates and other factors\\nmay result in actual payments differing from these estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments. We have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in preparing this information within\\nthe context of our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Interest payments on the January 2019 Notes,\\n2019 Notes and 2021 Notes presented in the contractual obligations table above have been estimated using interest rates of 0.93%, 0.76% and 0.91%, respectively, which represented our effective interest rates for these senior notes as of May\\xa031,\\n2015 after consideration of these fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements, and are subject to change in future periods.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOur 2017 Notes, our floating rate senior notes due January 2019 and our 2019 Floating Rate Notes bore interest at a rate of 0.47%, 0.86% and 0.78%, respectively, as of\\nMay\\xa031, 2015 and interest payments on these notes presented in the contractual obligations table above have been estimated using this rate. \\n \\xa0 73 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOur 2.25% senior notes due January 2021 (January 2021 Notes) and our 3.125% senior notes due July 2025 (July 2025 Notes) are denominated in Euro. In connection with the\\nissuance of the January 2021 Notes, we entered into certain cross-currency swap agreements that have the economic effect of converting our fixed rate, Euro denominated debt, including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at\\nmaturity, to a fixed rate, U.S.\\xa0Dollar denominated debt of $1.6 billion with a fixed annual interest rate of 3.53%. Principal and interest payments for the January 2021 Notes presented in the contractual obligations table above were calculated\\nbased on the terms of the aforementioned cross-currency swap agreements. Principal and interest payments for the July 2025 Notes presented in the contractual obligations table above were estimated using foreign currency exchange rates as of\\nMay\\xa031, 2015.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n(2)\\xa0\\n Primarily represents leases of facilities and includes future minimum rent payments for facilities that we have vacated pursuant to our restructuring\\nand merger integration activities.

We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for our hardware products and to perform final assembly and testing of\\nfinished hardware products. We also obtain individual hardware components for our products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and\\nmanufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead-times and/or commercially standard lead-times for the particular part or product and have been included in the amount presented in the above contractual\\nobligations table. Routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to our external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in the ordinary course of business are not included in the amounts\\npresented above as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way.  As of May\\xa031, 2015, we had $4.8 billion of gross unrecognized income tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and all such obligations have\\nbeen excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty as to when they might be settled. We cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which the remainder of our unrecognized income tax benefits will be settled or released with\\nthe relevant tax authorities, although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal 2016.  We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures and contractual\\nobligation requirements. In addition, we believe we could fund any future acquisitions, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from\\noperations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities.  Off-Balance Sheet\\nArrangements:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses,\\nresults of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.  Selected Quarterly Financial\\nData  Quarterly revenues, expenses and operating income have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including sales\\nforce incentive compensation plans. In addition, our European operations generally provide lower revenues in our first fiscal quarter because of the reduced economic activity in Europe during the summer. These seasonal factors are common in the high\\ntechnology industry. These factors have caused a decrease in our first quarter revenues as compared to revenues in the immediately preceding fourth quarter, which historically has been our highest revenue quarter within a particular fiscal year.\\nSimilarly, the operating income of our business is affected by seasonal factors in a consistent manner as our revenues (in particular, our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions segment) as certain expenses within our cost structure\\nare relatively fixed in the short-term. We expect these trends to continue in fiscal 2016. \\n \\xa0 74 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n The following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly information for our last eight fiscal quarters.\\nWe believe that all necessary adjustments, which consisted only of normal recurring adjustments, have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the results of such periods when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial\\nstatements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The sum of the quarterly financial information may vary from the annual data due to rounding.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nFiscal 2015 Quarter Ended (Unaudited)\\n\\xa0\\n\\n (in millions, except per share amounts)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nAugust\\xa031\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nNovember\\xa030\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nFebruary\\xa028\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nMay\\xa031\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Revenues\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n8,596\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n9,598\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n9,327\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa010,706\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Gross profit\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n6,878\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n7,657\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n7,394\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n8,611\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Operating income\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n2,963\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n3,542\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n3,383\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n3,982\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Net income\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n2,184\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n2,502\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n2,495\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n2,758\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Earnings per share\\x97basic\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.49\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.57\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.57\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.63\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Earnings per share\\x97diluted\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.48\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.56\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.56\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.62\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nFiscal 2014 Quarter Ended (Unaudited)\\n\\xa0\\n\\n (in millions, except per share amounts)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nAugust\\xa031\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nNovember\\xa030\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nFebruary\\xa028\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nMay 31\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Revenues\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n8,372\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n9,275\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n9,307\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa011,320\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Gross profit\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n6,607\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n7,420\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n7,490\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n9,340\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Operating income\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n2,873\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n3,410\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n3,567\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n4,909\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Net income\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n2,191\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n2,553\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n2,565\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n3,646\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Earnings per share\\x97basic\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.48\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.56\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.57\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.81\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Earnings per share\\x97diluted\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.47\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.56\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.56\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n0.80\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n Stock Options and Restricted Stock-Based Awards  Our stock-based compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of\\nexisting stockholders.  We recognize that stock options and restricted stock-based awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to\\ncontrol the number of stock options and restricted stock-based awards granted while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June\\xa01, 2012 has been a weighted average\\nannualized rate of 1.9%\\xa0per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new stock options or restricted stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of stock options and restricted stock-based awards forfeited\\nby employees leaving the company, divided by the weighted average outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all stock options are exercised and restricted stock-based awards vest. Of the\\noutstanding stock options at May\\xa031, 2015, which generally have a 10-year exercise period, less than 1.0% have exercise prices higher than the market price of our common stock on such date. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has more\\nthan offset the dilutive effect of our stock-based compensation program; however, we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay or repurchase indebtedness\\nor for other purposes. At May\\xa031, 2015, the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding and unexercised stock options and restricted stock-based awards, regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including\\nstock options where the strike price is higher than the market price as of such date, was 10.2%. \\n \\xa0 75 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviews and approves the organization-wide stock-based\\naward grants to selected employees, all stock-based award grants to executive officers and any individual grant of stock-based awards in excess of 100,000 stock option equivalent shares. A separate Plan Committee, which is an executive officer\\ncommittee, approves individual stock-based award grants of up to 100,000 stock option equivalent shares to non-executive officers and employees.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  For information with respect to recent accounting\\npronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. \\nItem\\xa07A.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk \\nCash, Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities and Interest Income Risk  Our bank deposits and time deposits are generally held with large, diverse financial institutions worldwide with high investment grade credit ratings or financial institutions that meet investment grade\\nratings criteria, which we believe mitigates credit risk and certain other risks. In addition, as of May\\xa031, 2015, substantially all of our marketable securities are high quality with approximately 28% having maturity dates within one year and\\n72% having maturity dates within one to six years (see a description of our marketable securities held in Note 3 and Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report and \\x93Liquidity and Capital\\nResources\\x94 above). We hold a mix of both fixed and floating rate debt securities. Our floating rate debt securities serve to lower the overall risk to our investments portfolio associated with the risk of rising interest rates. The fair values\\nof our fixed rate debt securities are impacted by interest rate movements and if interest rates increased by 50 basis points as of May\\xa031, 2015, we estimate the change would decrease the fair\\n\\n \\xa0 76 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nvalues of our marketable securities holdings by $191 million. Substantially all of our marketable securities are designated as available-for-sale. We generally do not use our investments for\\ntrading purposes.  Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our cash, cash equivalents\\nand marketable securities. For fiscal 2015, total interest income was $349 million with our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities investments yielding an average 0.79% on a worldwide basis. The table below presents the approximate fair\\nvalues of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the related weighted average interest rates for our investment portfolio at May\\xa031, 2015 and 2014. \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nMay\\xa031,\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2015\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2014\\n\\xa0\\n\\n (Dollars in millions)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nFair Value\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nWeightedAverageInterest Rate\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nFair Value\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nWeightedAverageInterest Rate\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Cash and cash equivalents\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa021,716\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n0.36%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa017,769\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n0.37%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Marketable securities\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n32,652\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n1.07%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n21,050\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n1.14%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n54,368\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n0.79%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n38,819\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n0.79%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Interest Expense Risk  Interest Expense Risk\\x97Fixed to Variable Interest Rate Swap Agreements   Our total borrowings were $42.0 billion as of May\\xa031, 2015, consisting of $39.7 billion of fixed rate borrowings and $2.3 billion of floating rate borrowings (Floating Rate Notes). During fiscal\\n2015, we issued $20.0\\xa0billion of senior notes comprised of $1.75 billion of floating rate notes and $18.25 billion of fixed rate notes as described in the \\x93Recent Financing Activities\\x94 section of Management\\x92s Discussion and\\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 7) in this Annual Report. In July 2014, we entered into certain interest rate\\nswap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with our $2.0 billion of 2.25% senior notes due October 2019 (2019 Notes) and our $1.5 billion of 2.80% senior notes due July 2021 (2021 Notes) so\\nthat the interest payable on the 2019 Notes and the 2021 Notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. In July 2013, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations\\nassociated with our $1.5 billion of 2.375% senior notes due January 2019 (January 2019 Notes) so that the interest payable on the January 2019 Notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. The critical terms of the interest rate swap agreements\\nmatch the critical terms of the 2019 Notes, 2021 Notes and the January 2019 Notes that the interest rate swap agreements pertain to, including the notional amounts and maturity dates. We do not use these interest rate swap arrangements or our fixed\\nrate borrowings for trading purposes. We are accounting for these interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The total fair value gain of these fixed to variable interest rate swap\\nagreements as of May\\xa031, 2015 was $74 million. If LIBOR-based interest rates increased by 100 basis points as of May\\xa031, 2015, the change would decrease the fair values of the fixed to variable swap agreements by $221 million. Additional\\ndetails regarding our senior notes and related interest rate swap agreements are included in Notes 8 and 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. \\nBy issuing the Floating Rate Notes and entering into the aforementioned interest rate swap arrangements, we have assumed risks associated with variable\\ninterest rates based upon LIBOR.\\xa0As of May\\xa031, 2015, the weighted average interest rate associated with our Floating Rate Notes and January 2019 Notes, 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes, after considering the effects of the aforementioned interest\\nrate swap arrangements, was 0.79%. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations.\\xa0An interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by\\ncomputing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest rates.\\xa0As of May\\xa031, 2015, if\\xa0LIBOR-based interest rates increased by 100 basis points, the change would increase our interest expense\\nannually by approximately $73 million as it relates to our fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements and floating rate borrowings. \\n \\xa0 77 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n In July 2014, our 3.75% senior notes due July 2014 for $1.5 billion matured and were repaid, and we settled\\nthe fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements associated with such fixed rate senior notes.  Currency Risk \\nForeign Currency Transaction and Translation Risks\\x97Foreign Currency Borrowings and Related Hedges  \\nIn July 2013, we issued \\x801.25 billion of 2.25% notes due January 2021 (January 2021 Notes) and we entered into certain cross-currency swap agreements\\nto manage the related foreign exchange risk by effectively converting the fixed-rate Euro denominated debt, including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate, U.S.\\xa0Dollar denominated debt. The\\neconomic effect of the swap agreements was to eliminate the uncertainty of the cash flows in U.S. Dollars associated with the January 2021 Notes by fixing the principal amount of the January 2021 Notes at $1.6 billion with an annual interest rate of\\n3.53%. The critical terms of the cross-currency swap agreements match the critical terms of January 2021 Notes, including the notional amounts and maturity dates. We do not use these cross-currency swap arrangements for trading purposes. We are\\naccounting for these interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges pursuant to ASC 815. The fair values of these cross-currency swap agreements as of May\\xa031, 2015 and 2014 were a $(244) million loss and a $74 million gain, respectively. The\\nchanges in the fair values of the cross-currency swap agreements during fiscal 2015 were primarily attributable to the decline in the value of the Euro relative to the U.S. Dollar. If the Euro weakened by 10% as of May\\xa031, 2015, we estimate the\\nchange would decrease the fair values of the cross-currency swap agreements by $174 million. If interest rates that correspond to the remaining term of the January 2021 Notes decreased by 100 basis points as of May\\xa031, 2015, we estimate the\\nchange would decrease the fair values of the cross-currency swap agreements by $91 million. Additional details regarding our senior notes and related cross-currency swap agreements are included in Notes 8 and 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial\\nStatements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.  In July 2013, we also issued \\x80750\\xa0million of 3.125% notes due July 2025 (2025\\nNotes). We designated the 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholders\\x92 equity caused by\\nthe changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the U.S. Dollar. As a result, the change in the carrying value of the Euro denominated 2025 Notes due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on the effective\\nportion is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report and totaled $208\\nmillion of net other comprehensive gains for fiscal 2015. Any remaining change in the carrying value of the 2025 Notes representing the ineffective portion of the net investment hedge is recognized in non-operating income (expense), net. We did not\\nrecord any ineffectiveness during fiscal 2015.  Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the Euro and the U.S.\\xa0Dollar will impact the\\namount of U.S. Dollars that we will require to settle the 2025 Notes at maturity. If the U.S.\\xa0Dollar weakened by 10% in comparison to the Euro as of May\\xa031, 2015, we estimate our obligation to cash settle the principal portion of the 2025\\nNotes in U.S. Dollars would increase by approximately $81 million.  Foreign Currency Transaction Risk\\x97Foreign\\nCurrency Forward Contracts  We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes\\nforeign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our\\nforeign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions. We may suspend this program from time to time. Our\\nforeign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees, intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. \\nWe neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant\\nto ASC 815. Accordingly, we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statement of operations. Given the short duration\\nof the forward contracts, the amount recorded is \\n \\xa0 78 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nnot significant. The balance sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is prepaid expenses and other current assets for a net unrealized gain position and other current\\nliabilities for a net unrealized loss position. The statement of operations classification for changes in fair values of these forward contracts is non-operating income (expense), net for both realized and unrealized gains and losses. \\nWe expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign\\ncurrency forward contracts. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these\\nexposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors. As of May\\xa031, 2015 and 2014, the notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase U.S. Dollars in\\nexchange for other major international currencies were $2.2 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. As of May\\xa031, 2015 and 2014, the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international\\ncurrencies were $1.2 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal at May\\xa031, 2015 and 2014. Net foreign exchange transaction losses included in non-operating income\\n(expense), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $157 million, $375 million and $162 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Included in the net foreign exchange transaction losses for fiscal 2015, fiscal\\n2014 and fiscal 2013 were foreign currency remeasurement losses relating to our Venezuelan subsidiary\\x92s operations of $23 million, $213 million and $64 million, respectively (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included\\nelsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information). As a large portion of our consolidated operations are international, we could experience additional foreign currency volatility in the future, the amounts and timing of which are unknown.\\n Foreign Currency Translation Risk\\x97Impact on Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities \\nFluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of\\nthese amounts into U.S. Dollars. In particular, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by these subsidiaries is subject to translation variance caused\\nby changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and is also presented as a line\\nitem in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report).  As the U.S.\\xa0Dollar fluctuated\\nagainst certain international currencies as of the end of fiscal 2015, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for foreign subsidiaries that hold international currencies as of May\\xa031,\\n2015 decreased relative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate as of May\\xa031, 2014. As reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, the estimated effects of exchange rate changes on our reported cash and cash\\nequivalents balances in U.S. Dollars for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 were decreases of $1.2 billion, $158 million and $110 million, respectively. The following table includes estimates of the U.S.\\xa0Dollar equivalent of cash, cash equivalents and\\nmarketable securities denominated in certain major foreign currencies that we held as of May\\xa031, 2015:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n (in millions)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nU.S.\\xa0DollarEquivalent\\xa0atMay\\xa031, 2015\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Euro\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n2,190\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Japanese Yen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n1,143\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Indian Rupee\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n674\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Saudi Arabian Riyal\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n445\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Chinese Renminbi\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n427\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Australian Dollar\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n397\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n South African Rand\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n344\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Canadian Dollar\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n231\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Other foreign currencies\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n1,802\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated in foreign currencies\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n7,653\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n \\xa0 79 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n If overall foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the U.S.\\xa0Dollar uniformly weakened by 10%,\\nthe amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities we would report in U.S. Dollars would decrease by approximately $765 million, assuming constant foreign currency cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances. \\nItem\\xa08.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Financial Statements and Supplementary Data \\nThe response to this item is submitted as a separate section of this Annual Report.

Disclosure controls are procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, such as this\\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Disclosure controls are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and\\ncommunicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officers and our Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our quarterly evaluation of disclosure controls includes an\\nevaluation of some components of our internal control over financial reporting. We also perform a separate annual evaluation of internal control over financial reporting for the purpose of providing the management report below. \\nThe evaluation of our disclosure controls included a review of their objectives and design, our implementation of the controls and the effect of the\\ncontrols on the information generated for use in this Annual Report on Form\\xa010-K. In the course of the controls evaluation, we reviewed data errors or control problems identified and sought to confirm\\nthat appropriate corrective actions, including process improvements, were being undertaken. This type of evaluation is performed on a quarterly basis so that the conclusions of management, including our Principal Executive Officers and our Principal\\nFinancial Officer, concerning the effectiveness of the disclosure controls can be reported in our periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K. Many of the components of our disclosure controls are also evaluated on an ongoing basis by both our\\ninternal audit and finance organizations. The overall goals of these various evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and to modify them as necessary. We intend to maintain our disclosure controls as dynamic processes and\\nprocedures that we adjust as circumstances merit.  Based on our management\\x92s evaluation (with the participation of our Principal Executive\\nOfficers and our Principal Financial Officer), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our Principal Executive Officers and our Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\\n Management\\x92s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting  Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the\\nsupervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive Officers and our Principal Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of\\nMay\\xa031, 2015 based on the guidelines established in Internal Control\\x97Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\\x92s 2013 framework. Our internal control over financial\\nreporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted\\naccounting principles. \\n \\xa0 80 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial\\nreporting was effective as of May\\xa031, 2015. We reviewed the results of management\\x92s assessment with our Finance and Audit Committee. \\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May\\xa031, 2015 has been audited by Ernst\\xa0& Young LLP, an independent\\nregistered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Part IV, Item\\xa015 of this Annual Report.  Changes\\nin Internal Control over Financial Reporting  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in\\nconnection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d)\\xa0of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over\\nfinancial reporting.  Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls  Our management, including our Principal Executive Officers and our Principal Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are\\ndesigned to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial\\nreporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control\\nsystem must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute\\nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or\\nmistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain\\nassumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in\\nconditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. \\nItem\\xa09B.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Other Information  None. \\n \\xa0 81 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n PART III  Item\\xa010. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance  Pursuant to General Instruction G(3) of Form 10-K, the information required by this item relating to our executive officers is included under the caption \\x93Executive Officers of the Registrant\\x94\\nin Part I of this Annual Report.

Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item\\xa015(a) 2. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of\\nthe Company\\x92s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.  We\\nconducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements\\nare free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates\\nmade by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Oracle Corporation at May\\xa031, 2015 and 2014, and the\\nconsolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May\\xa031, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement\\nschedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Oracle Corporation\\x92s internal control over financial reporting as of\\nMay\\xa031, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated June\\xa025, 2015 expressed an\\nunqualified opinion thereon.  /s/ Ernst\\xa0& Young LLP  San Jose, California  June\\xa025, 2015 \\n \\xa0 84 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \\nThe Board of Directors and Stockholders of Oracle Corporation  We have audited Oracle Corporation\\x92s internal control over financial reporting as of May\\xa031, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control\\x97Integrated Framework issued by the\\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Oracle Corporation\\x92s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of\\nthe effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management\\x92s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company\\x92s internal control\\nover financial reporting based on our audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting\\nOversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included\\nobtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing\\nsuch other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \\nA company\\x92s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial\\nreporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\\x92s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that\\n(1)\\xa0pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)\\xa0provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as\\nnecessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors\\nof the company; and (3)\\xa0provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\\x92s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\n Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of\\nany evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \\nIn our opinion, Oracle Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May\\xa031, 2015,\\nbased on the COSO criteria.  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\\nStates), the consolidated balance sheets of Oracle Corporation as of May\\xa031, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended\\nMay\\xa031, 2015 of Oracle Corporation and our report dated June\\xa025, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.  /s/\\nErnst\\xa0& Young LLP  San Jose, California  June\\xa025, 2015 \\n \\xa0 85 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of

Oracle Corporation develops, manufactures, markets, sells, hosts and supports database and middleware software, application software,\\ncloud infrastructure, hardware systems\\x97including Oracle Engineered Systems, computer server, storage, networking and industry specific hardware products\\x97and related services that are engineered to work together in cloud-based and\\non-premises information technology (IT) environments. We offer our customers the option to purchase our software and hardware systems products and related services to manage their own cloud-based or on-premises IT environments, or to deploy our\\ncomprehensive set of cloud service offerings including Oracle Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Customers that purchase our software products may elect to purchase software license\\nupdates and product support contracts, which provide our customers with rights to unspecified product upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period as well as technical support assistance. Customers that purchase our hardware\\nproducts may elect to purchase hardware systems support contracts, which provide customers with software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products, such as Oracle Solaris and certain other\\nsoftware products, and can include product repairs, maintenance services, and technical support services. We also offer customers a broad set of services offerings including consulting services, advanced customer support services and education\\nservices.  Oracle Corporation conducts business globally and was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to\\noperations originally begun in June 1977.  Basis of Financial Statements  The consolidated financial statements included our accounts and the accounts of our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. Noncontrolling interest positions of certain of our consolidated entities are\\nreported as a separate component of consolidated equity from the equity attributable to Oracle\\x92s stockholders for all periods presented. The noncontrolling interests in our net income were not significant to our consolidated results for the\\nperiods presented and therefore have been included as a component of non-operating income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Certain other prior year balances\\nhave been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Such reclassifications did not affect total revenues, operating income or net income. Acquisition related and other expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2015 included $186 million related to a goodwill impairment loss (refer to Note 7 below for\\nadditional information) and for fiscal 2015 and 2013 included benefits of $53 million and $306 million, respectively, related to certain litigation (refer to Note 18 below for additional information). Further, acquisition related and other expenses\\nfor fiscal 2013 included a change in fair value of contingent consideration payable, which resulted in a net benefit of $387 million in fiscal 2013 (refer to Note 2 below for additional information). \\nIn fiscal 2015, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.\\xa02015-03, Interest\\x97Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30):\\nSimplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs (ASU 2015-03). In connection with the adoption of ASU 2015-03, we reclassified debt issuance costs related to our senior notes from other assets to notes payable, non-current as a deduction to\\nthe carrying amounts of our senior notes in our May\\xa031, 2015 and 2014 consolidated balance sheets. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  \\nIn fiscal 2015, we also adopted ASU 2015-02, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis, ASU 2015-01, Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by\\nEliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items, ASU 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity\\x92s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, ASU 2014-12, Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide\\nThat a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period, and ASU 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, none of which had an impact on our reported\\nfinancial position or results of operations and cash flows. \\n \\xa0 91 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2015  \\xa0\\n Use of Estimates  Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board\\x92s (FASB) Accounting\\nStandards Codification (ASC) and we consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates,\\njudgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates,\\njudgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent there are differences\\nbetween these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our consolidated financial statements will be affected. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require\\nmanagement\\x92s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management\\x92s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. \\nRevenue Recognition  Our sources of\\nrevenues include: (1)\\xa0software and cloud revenues, including new software licenses revenues earned from granting licenses to use our software products and industry specific software; cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues generated from fees for granting\\ncustomers access to a broad range of our software and related support offerings on a subscription basis in a secure, standards-based cloud computing environment; cloud IaaS revenues generated from fees for deployment and management offerings for our\\nsoftware and hardware and related IT infrastructure generally on a subscription basis; and software license updates and product support revenues (described further below); (2)\\xa0hardware systems revenues, which include the sale of hardware\\nsystems products including Oracle Engineered Systems, computer servers, storage products, networking and data center fabric products, and industry specific hardware; and hardware systems support revenues; and (3)\\xa0services, which include\\nsoftware and hardware related services including consulting, advanced customer support and education revenues. Revenues generally are recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\\n Revenue Recognition for Software Products and Software Related Services (Software Elements) \\nNew software licenses revenues primarily represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database, middleware and application software\\nand exclude cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues and revenues derived from software license updates, which are included in software license updates and product support revenues. The basis for our new software licenses revenue recognition is substantially\\ngoverned by the accounting guidance contained in ASC 985-605, Software-Revenue Recognition. We exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software and software related services revenues to be\\nrecognized in each accounting period.  For software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the\\nunderlying software, we recognize new software licenses revenues when: (1)\\xa0we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software; (2)\\xa0we deliver the products; (3)\\xa0the sale price is fixed or\\ndeterminable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties; and (4)\\xa0collection is probable. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met, are recognized when those conditions are\\nsubsequently met.  Substantially all of our software license arrangements do not include acceptance provisions. However, if acceptance\\nprovisions exist as part of public policy, for example, in agreements with government entities where acceptance periods are required by law, or within previously executed terms and conditions that are referenced in the current agreement and are\\nshort-term in nature, we generally recognize revenues upon delivery provided the \\n \\xa0 92 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2015  \\xa0\\n \\nacceptance terms are perfunctory and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. If acceptance provisions are not perfunctory (for example, acceptance provisions that are long-term in\\nnature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement), revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period.  The vast majority of our software license arrangements include software license updates and product support contracts, which are entered into at the customer\\x92s option and are recognized ratably over\\nthe term of the arrangement, typically one year. Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period. Product support\\nincludes internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel. Software license updates and product support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net new software licenses\\nfees. Substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually.  Revenue Recognition\\nfor Multiple-Element Arrangements\\x97Software Products and Software Related Services (Software Arrangements)  We often enter into\\narrangements with customers that purchase both software related products and software related services from us at the same time, or within close proximity of one another (referred to as software related multiple-element arrangements). Such software\\nrelated multiple-element arrangements include the sale of our software products, software license updates and product support contracts and other software related services whereby software license delivery is followed by the subsequent or\\ncontemporaneous delivery of the other elements. For those software related multiple-element arrangements, we have applied the residual method to determine the amount of new software license revenues to be recognized pursuant to ASC 985-605. Under\\nthe residual method, if fair value exists for undelivered elements in a multiple-element arrangement, such fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred with the remaining portion of the arrangement consideration generally recognized upon\\ndelivery of the software license. We allocate the fair value of each element of a software related multiple-element arrangement based upon its fair value as determined by our vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE\\x97described further below),\\nwith any remaining amount allocated to the software license.  Revenue Recognition for Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS Offerings, Hardware\\nSystems Products, Hardware Systems Support and Related Services (Nonsoftware Elements)  Our revenue recognition policy for nonsoftware\\ndeliverables including cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, hardware systems products, support and related services is based upon the accounting guidance contained in ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition, Multiple-Element Arrangements, and\\nwe exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues, hardware systems products revenues, support and related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period.\\n Revenues from the sales of our nonsoftware elements are recognized when: (1)\\xa0persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2)\\xa0we\\ndeliver the products and passage of the title to the buyer occurs; (3)\\xa0the sale price is fixed or determinable; and (4)\\xa0collection is reasonably assured. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions\\nare not met are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met. When applicable, we reduce revenues for estimated returns or certain other incentive programs where we have the ability to sufficiently estimate the effects of these items. Where\\nan arrangement is subject to acceptance criteria and the acceptance provisions are not perfunctory (for example, acceptance provisions that are long-term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement), revenues are recognized\\nupon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period.  Our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings generally\\nprovide customers access to certain of our software within a cloud-based IT environment that we manage, host and support and offer to customers on a subscription basis. Revenues for our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings are generally recognized ratably\\nover the contract term commencing with the date the service is made available to customers and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. \\n \\xa0 93 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2015  \\xa0\\n Our cloud IaaS offerings provide deployment and management offerings for our software and hardware and\\nrelated IT infrastructure including comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services arrangements for customer IT infrastructure for a stated term that is hosted at our data center facilities, select partner data centers or\\nphysically on-premises at customer facilities generally for a term-based fee; and virtual machine instances that are subscription-based and designed for computing and reliable and secure object storage. Revenues for these cloud IaaS offerings are\\ngenerally recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date the service is made available to customers and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied.  Revenues from the sale of hardware systems products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of our Oracle Engineered Systems, computer servers, storage, networking and industry specific hardware.\\n Our hardware systems support offerings generally provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the\\nfunctionality of our hardware products and can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware systems support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware systems products fees.\\nHardware systems support contracts are entered into at the customer\\x92s option and are recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangements, which are typically one year.  Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements\\x97Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS Offerings, Hardware Systems Products, Hardware Systems Support and Related Services (Nonsoftware Arrangements)\\n We enter into arrangements with customers that purchase both nonsoftware related products and services from us at the same time, or within\\nclose proximity of one another (referred to as nonsoftware multiple-element arrangements). Each element within a nonsoftware multiple-element arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting provided the following criteria are met: the\\ndelivered products or services have value to the customer on a standalone basis; and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services, delivery or performance of the undelivered product or\\nservice is considered probable and is substantially controlled by us. We consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by us or another vendor or could be resold by the customer. Further, our revenue\\narrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products. Where the aforementioned criteria for a separate unit of accounting are not met, the deliverable is combined with the undelivered element(s) and\\ntreated as a single unit of accounting for the purposes of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition. For those units of accounting that include more than one deliverable but are treated as a single unit of accounting, we\\ngenerally recognize revenues over the contractual period of the arrangement or in the case of our cloud offerings, we generally recognize revenues over the contractual term of the cloud software subscription. For the purposes of revenue\\nclassification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we allocate revenue to the respective revenue line items within our consolidated statements of operations based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing\\nour best estimate of relative selling prices of such elements.  For our nonsoftware multiple-element arrangements, we allocate revenue to each\\nelement based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangement\\x92s inception. The selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy: VSOE if available, third party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or\\nestimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE are available (a description as to how we determine VSOE, TPE and ESP is provided below). If a tangible hardware systems product includes software, we determine whether the tangible hardware\\nsystems product and the software work together to deliver the product\\x92s essential functionality and, if so, the entire product is treated as a nonsoftware deliverable. The total arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of\\naccounting for each of the nonsoftware deliverables using the relative selling prices of each unit based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. We limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to an amount that is not\\ncontingent upon future delivery of additional products or services or meeting of any specified performance conditions. \\n \\xa0 94 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2015  \\xa0\\n When possible, we establish VSOE of selling price for deliverables in software and nonsoftware\\nmultiple-element arrangements using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and for software license updates and product support and hardware systems support, based on the renewal rates offered to customers. TPE is established by\\nevaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated customers. If we are unable to determine the selling price because VSOE or TPE does not exist, we determine ESP for the\\npurposes of allocating the arrangement by reviewing historical transactions, including transactions whereby the deliverable was sold on a standalone basis and considering several other external and internal factors including, but not limited to,\\npricing practices including discounting, margin objectives, competition, contractually stated prices, the geographies in which we offer our products and services, the type of customer (i.e., distributor, value added reseller, government agency and\\ndirect end user, among others) and the stage of the product lifecycle. The determination of ESP is made through consultation with and approval by our management, taking into consideration our pricing model and go-to-market strategy. As our, or our\\ncompetitors\\x92, pricing and go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes to our determination of VSOE, TPE and ESP. As a result, our future revenue recognition for\\nmultiple-element arrangements could differ materially from our results in the current period. Selling prices are analyzed on an annual basis or more frequently if we experience significant changes in our selling prices. \\nRevenue Recognition Policies Applicable to both Software and Nonsoftware Elements  Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements\\x97Arrangements with Software and Nonsoftware Elements  We also enter into multiple-element arrangements that may include a combination of our various software related and nonsoftware related products and services offerings including new software licenses,\\nsoftware license updates and product support, cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, hardware systems products, hardware systems support, consulting, advanced customer support services and education. In such arrangements, we first allocate the total\\narrangement consideration based on the relative selling prices of the software group of elements as a whole and to the nonsoftware elements. We then further allocate consideration within the software group to the respective elements within that\\ngroup following the guidance in ASC 985-605 and our policies as described above. After the arrangement consideration has been allocated to the elements, we account for each respective element in the arrangement as described above. \\nOther Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to Software and Nonsoftware Elements  Many of our software arrangements include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts and are included as a part of our services business. Consulting revenues\\nfrom these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from new software licenses revenues because the arrangements qualify as services transactions as defined in ASC 985-605. The more significant factors considered in determining whether\\nthe revenues should be accounted for separately include the nature of services (i.e., consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product), degree of risk, availability of services from other vendors,\\ntiming of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee. Revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed. If there is a significant uncertainty about\\nthe project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services, revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved. We estimate the proportional performance on contracts with fixed or \\x93not to exceed\\x94 fees on a\\nmonthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project. If we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion, revenues are recognized when we receive final acceptance\\nfrom the customer that the services have been completed. When total cost estimates exceed revenues, we accrue for the estimated losses immediately using cost estimates that are based upon an average fully\\n\\n \\xa0 95 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2015  \\xa0\\n \\nburdened daily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the services. The complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties\\ninherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affects the amounts of revenues and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements. A number of internal and external factors can affect our\\nestimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes.  Our advanced\\ncustomer support services are offered as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying other software and non-software products and services. We offer these advanced support services, both on-premises and remote, to Oracle\\ncustomers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their products and services. Depending upon the nature of the arrangement, revenues from these services are recognized as the services are performed or ratably over the term of the\\nservice period, which is generally one year or less.  Education revenues are also a part of our services business and include instructor-led,\\nmedia-based and internet-based training in the use of our software and hardware products. Education revenues are recognized as the classes or other education offerings are delivered.  If an arrangement contains multiple elements and does not qualify for separate accounting for the product and service transactions, then new software licenses revenues and/or hardware systems products\\nrevenues, including the costs of hardware systems products, are generally recognized together with the services based on contract accounting using either the percentage-of-completion or completed-contract method. Contract accounting is applied to\\nany bundled software and cloud, hardware systems and services arrangements: (1)\\xa0that include milestones or customer specific acceptance criteria that may affect collection of the software license or hardware systems product fees; (2)\\xa0where\\nconsulting services include significant modification or customization of the software or hardware systems product or are of a specialized nature and generally performed only by Oracle; (3)\\xa0where significant consulting services are provided for\\nin the software license contract or hardware systems product contract without additional charge or are substantially discounted; or (4)\\xa0where the software license or hardware systems product payment is tied to the performance of consulting\\nservices. For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we allocate revenues to software and nonsoftware elements based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best\\nestimate of the relative selling price of such elements.  We also evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing \\x93fiscal\\nfunding\\x94 or \\x93termination for convenience\\x94 provisions, when such provisions are required by law, to determine the probability of possible cancellation. We consider multiple factors, including the history with the customer in similar\\ntransactions, the \\x93essential use\\x94 of the software or hardware systems products and the planning, budgeting and approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity. If we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the\\nlikelihood of cancellation is remote, we then recognize revenues once all of the criteria described above have been met. If such a determination cannot be made, revenues are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable\\nfunding provision by the governmental entity.  We assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenues if\\nall other revenue recognition requirements are met. Our standard payment terms are net 30 days. However, payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed. Payments that are due within six months are generally deemed to\\nbe fixed or determinable based on our successful collection history on such arrangements, and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition.  While most of our arrangements for sales within our businesses include short-term payment terms, we have a standard practice of providing long-term financing to creditworthy customers primarily through\\nour financing division. Since fiscal 1989, when our financing division was formed, we have established a history of collection, without concessions, on these receivables with payment terms that generally extend up to five years from the\\n\\n \\xa0 96 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2015  \\xa0\\n \\ncontract date. Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, we recognize new software licenses revenues and hardware systems products revenues for these arrangements upon\\ndelivery, net of any payment discounts from financing transactions. We have generally sold receivables financed through our financing division on a non-recourse basis to third party financing institutions within 90 days of the contracts\\x92 dates\\nof execution and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We account for the sales of these receivables as \\x93true sales\\x94 as defined in ASC 860,\\nTransfers and Servicing, as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. During fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, $1.8 billion, $2.0 billion and $2.2 billion of our financing receivables were sold to financial\\ninstitutions, respectively.  In addition, we enter into arrangements with leasing companies for the sale of our hardware systems products.\\nThese leasing companies, in turn, lease our products to end-users. The leasing companies generally have no recourse to us in the event of default by the end-user and we recognize revenue upon delivery, if all other revenue recognition criteria have\\nbeen met.  Our customers include several of our suppliers and, occasionally, we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these\\nvendors at or about the same time that we have sold our products to these same companies (Concurrent Transactions). Software license agreements or sales of hardware systems that occur within a three-month time period from the date we have purchased\\ngoods or services from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure. When we acquire goods or services from a customer, we negotiate the purchase separately from any sales transaction, at terms we consider to\\nbe at arm\\x92s length and settle the purchase in cash. We recognize revenues from Concurrent Transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are met and the goods and services acquired are necessary for our current operations. \\nBusiness Combinations  We apply the\\nprovisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, in the accounting for our acquisitions. It requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of\\nthe acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value\\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to\\none year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired\\nor liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations.  Costs to\\nexit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company or our internal operations are accounted for as termination and exit costs pursuant to ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations, and are accounted for separately from the\\nbusiness combination. A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred. When estimating the\\nfair value of facility restructuring activities, assumptions are applied regarding estimated sub-lease payments to be received, which can differ materially from actual results. This may require us to revise our initial estimates which may materially\\naffect our results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made.  For a given acquisition, we may identify certain\\npre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these\\ncontingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts. \\n \\xa0 97 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2015  \\xa0\\n If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a pre-acquisition contingency (non-income tax\\nrelated) by the end of the measurement period, which is generally the case given the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (i)\\xa0it is probable that an asset existed or a\\nliability had been incurred at the acquisition date and (ii)\\xa0the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent to the measurement period, changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could\\nhave a material effect on our results of operations and financial position.  In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation\\nallowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to\\nour preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance\\x92s or contingency\\x92s estimated value, whichever comes\\nfirst, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial\\nposition.  Marketable and Non-Marketable Securities  In accordance with ASC 320, Investments\\x97Debt and Equity Securities, and based on our intentions regarding these instruments, we classify substantially all of our marketable debt\\nand equity securities as available-for-sale. Marketable debt and equity securities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value, with all unrealized gains (losses) reflected net of tax in stockholders\\x92 equity on our consolidated\\nbalance sheets, and as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. If we determine that an investment has an other than temporary decline in fair value, we recognize the investment loss in non-operating income (expense), net\\nin the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. We periodically evaluate our investments to determine if impairment charges are required. Substantially all of our marketable debt and equity investments are classified as current based on\\nthe nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.  We hold investments in certain non-marketable\\nequity securities in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence. These equity securities are recorded at cost and included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. If based on the terms of our\\nownership of these non-marketable securities, we determine that we exercise significant influence on the entity to which these non-marketable securities relate, we apply the requirements of ASC 323, Investments\\x97Equity Method and Joint\\nVentures, to account for such investments. Our non-marketable securities are subject to periodic impairment reviews.  Fair\\nValues of Financial Instruments  We apply the provisions of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (ASC 820), to our assets and liabilities\\nthat we are required to measure at fair value pursuant to other accounting standards, including our investments in marketable debt and equity securities and our derivative financial instruments. \\nThe additional disclosures regarding our fair value measurements are included in Note 4.  Allowances for Doubtful Accounts  We record allowances for doubtful accounts based upon a\\nspecific review of all significant outstanding invoices. For those invoices not specifically reviewed, provisions are provided at differing rates, based upon the age of the receivable, the collection history associated with the geographic region\\nthat the receivable was recorded in and current economic trends. We write-off a receivable and charge it against its recorded allowance when we have exhausted our collection efforts without success. \\n \\xa0 98 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2015  \\xa0\\n Concentrations of Risk  Financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivatives and trade receivables. Our cash and\\ncash equivalents are generally held with large, diverse financial institutions worldwide to reduce the amount of exposure to any single financial institution. Investment policies have been implemented that limit purchases of marketable debt\\nsecurities to investment grade securities. Our derivative contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standings. We generally do not require collateral to secure accounts receivable. The risk with respect to trade\\nreceivables is mitigated by credit evaluations we perform on our customers, the short duration of our payment terms for the significant majority of our customer contracts and by the diversification of our customer base. No single customer accounted\\nfor 10% or more of our total revenues in fiscal 2015, 2014 or 2013.  We outsource the design, manufacturing, assembly and delivery of certain\\nof our hardware products to a variety of companies, many of which are located outside the United States. Further, we have simplified our supply chain processes by reducing the number of third party manufacturing partners and the number of locations\\nwhere these third party manufacturers build our hardware systems products. The inability of these third party manufacturing partners to fulfill orders for our hardware products could adversely impact future operating results of our hardware systems\\nbusiness.  Inventories \\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is computed using standard cost, which approximates actual cost, on a first-in,\\nfirst-out basis. We evaluate our ending inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence. This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand within specific time horizons (generally six to nine\\nmonths). Inventories in excess of future demand are written down and charged to hardware systems products expenses. In addition, we assess the impact of changing technology to our inventories and we write down inventories that are considered\\nobsolete. At the point of loss recognition, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. \\nOther Receivables  Other receivables\\nrepresent value-added tax and sales tax receivables associated with the sale of our products and services to third parties. Other receivables are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets and totaled\\n$817 million and $906 million at May\\xa031, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  Deferred Sales Commissions \\nWe defer sales commission expenses associated with our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, and recognize the related expenses over the non-cancelable\\nterm of the related contracts, which are typically one to three years. Amortization of deferred sales commissions is included as a component of sales and marketing expense in our consolidated statements of operations. \\nProperty, Plant and Equipment  Property,\\nplant and equipment are stated at the lower of cost or realizable value, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from one to fifty years.\\nLeasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the lease terms, as appropriate. Property, plant and equipment are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in\\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We did not recognize any significant property impairment charges in fiscal 2015, 2014 or 2013. \\n \\xa0 99 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2015  \\xa0\\n Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Impairment Assessments \\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired.\\nIntangible assets that are not considered to have an indefinite useful life are amortized over their useful lives, which generally range from one to ten years. Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible\\nassets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization.  The carrying amounts of our\\ngoodwill and intangible assets are periodically reviewed for impairment (at least annually for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets) and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not\\nbe recoverable. According to ASC 350, Intangibles\\x97Goodwill and Other, we can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting unit\\x92s goodwill for impairment or we can directly perform the two step impairment test. Based\\non our qualitative assessment, if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) to be less than its carrying amount, the two step impairment test will be performed. In the\\nfirst step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not\\nrequired to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied\\nfair value of the reporting unit\\x92s goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit\\x92s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. During fiscal 2015, we recognized a $186\\nmillion goodwill impairment loss (refer to Note 7 below for additional information). We did not recognize any goodwill impairment charges in fiscal 2014 or 2013.  Recoverability of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. Recoverability of\\nindefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and\\nthe fair value of the impaired asset. We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2015, 2014 or 2013. \\nDerivative Financial Instruments  During\\nfiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, we used derivative and non-derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency and interest rate risks (see Note 11 below for additional information). We account for these instruments in accordance with ASC\\n815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815), which requires that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value as of the reporting date. ASC 815 also requires that changes\\nin our derivatives\\x92 fair values be recognized in earnings, unless specific hedge accounting and documentation criteria are met (i.e., the instruments are accounted for as hedges).  The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For a derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge, the\\ngain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change. The loss or gain attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized in earnings with an offset recorded to the item for which the risk is being hedged. For a derivative instrument\\ndesignated as a cash flow hedge, each reporting period we record the change in fair value on the effective portion to accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets and an amount is reclassified out of accumulated other\\ncomprehensive loss into earnings to offset the earnings impact that is attributable to the risk being hedged. For the non-derivative financial instrument designated as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain of our international\\nsubsidiaries, the change on account of remeasurement of the effective portion for each reporting period is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets. \\n \\xa0 100\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2015  \\xa0\\n We perform the effectiveness testing of our aforementioned designated hedges on a quarterly basis and\\nthe changes in ineffective portions, if any, are recognized immediately in earnings.  Legal Contingencies \\nWe are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential\\nfinancial exposure. A description of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under \\x93Business Combinations\\x94 above. For legal and other contingencies that are not a part\\nof a business combination or related to income taxes, we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Note 18 below provides\\nadditional information regarding certain of our legal contingencies.  Shipping and Handling Costs \\nOur shipping and handling costs for hardware systems products sales are included in hardware systems products expenses for all periods presented.\\n Foreign Currency  We\\ntransact business in various foreign currencies. In general, the functional currency of a foreign operation is the local country\\x92s currency. Consequently, revenues and expenses of operations outside the United States are translated into U.S.\\nDollars using weighted average exchange rates while assets and liabilities of operations outside the United States are translated into U.S. Dollars using exchange rates at the balance sheet date. The effects of foreign currency translation\\nadjustments are included in stockholders\\x92 equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and related periodic movements are summarized as a line item in our consolidated statements\\nof comprehensive income. Net foreign exchange transaction losses included in non-operating income (expense), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $157 million, $375 million and $162 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and\\n2013, respectively.  Stock-Based Compensation  We account for share-based payments to employees, including grants of service-based employee stock options, service-based restricted stock awards, performance-based restricted stock awards (PSUs) and\\npurchases under employee stock purchase plans, in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation\\x97Stock Compensation, which requires that share-based payments (to the extent they are compensatory) be recognized in our consolidated\\nstatements of operations based on their fair values and the estimated number of shares we ultimately expect will vest. For our service-based awards, we recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period of\\nthe award, which is generally four years. For our PSUs, we recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period for each separately vesting tranche, which is generally twelve months, as the performance\\nconditions to evaluate attainment of each tranche for each participant are independent of the performance conditions for the other tranches. We update the amount of stock-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, to record as of the end of\\neach reporting period based on the expected attainment of performance targets, which is subject to change until a final determination is known. Changes to the target estimates are reflected in the amount of stock-based compensation expense that we\\nrecognize for each tranche on a cumulative basis during the reporting period in which the target estimates are altered and may cause the amount of stock-based compensation expense that we record for such reporting period to vary. \\n \\xa0 101\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2015  \\xa0\\n We record deferred tax assets for stock-based compensation awards that result in deductions on our\\nincome tax returns based on the amount of stock-based compensation recognized and the fair value attributable to the vested portion of stock awards assumed in connection with a business combination, at the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in\\nwhich we will receive a tax deduction.  Advertising  All advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses, which are included within sales and marketing expenses, were $55 million, $79 million and $85 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013,\\nrespectively.  Research and Development and Software Development Costs  All research and development costs are expensed as incurred.  Software development costs required\\nto be capitalized under ASC 985-20, Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased or Marketed, and under ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software, were not material to our consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013. \\nAcquisition Related and Other Expenses \\nAcquisition related and other expenses consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, stock-based compensation expenses,\\nintegration related professional services, certain business combination adjustments including adjustments after the measurement period has ended and certain other operating items, net. Stock-based compensation included in acquisition related and\\nother expenses result from unvested options and restricted stock-based awards assumed from acquisitions whereby vesting was accelerated upon termination of the employees pursuant to the original terms of those options and restricted stock-based\\nawards.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nYear Ended May\\xa031,\\n\\xa0\\n\\n (in millions)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2015\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2014\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2013\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Transitional and other employee related costs\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa057\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa027\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa027\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Stock-based compensation\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n5\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n10\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n33\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Professional fees and other, net\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(35\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n20\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(276\\n)\\xa0\\n\\n Business combination adjustments, net\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n184\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(16\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(388\\n)\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Total acquisition related and other expenses\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n211\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n41\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n(604\\n)\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n Included in acquisition related and other expenses for fiscal 2015 was a goodwill impairment loss of $186 million (refer\\nto Note 7 below for additional information).

We incurred losses related to our Venezuelan subsidiary of $213 million and\\n$64 million during fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively, for generally similar reasons.  Income Taxes \\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recorded for the expected tax consequences of\\ntemporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts recognized for income tax purposes. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax\\nbenefit that is more likely than not to be realized.  A two-step approach is applied pursuant to ASC 740 in the recognition and measurement of\\nuncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit, including\\nresolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to\\nuncertain tax positions in our provision for income taxes line of our consolidated statements of operations.  A description of our accounting\\npolicies associated with tax related contingencies and valuation allowances assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under \\x93Business Combinations\\x94 above.

If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the customer should account for the\\nsoftware license element of the arrangement \\n \\xa0 103\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2015  \\xa0\\n \\nconsistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service\\ncontract. The new guidance does not change the accounting for a customer\\x92s accounting for service contracts. ASU 2015-05 is effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2017 with early adoption permitted using either of two methods:\\n(i)\\xa0prospective to all arrangements entered into or materially modified after the effective date and represent a change in accounting principle; or (ii)\\xa0retrospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU\\n2015-05 on our consolidated financial statements.  Revenue Recognition:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU\\n2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606 (ASU 2014-09), to supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services\\nare transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is possible more\\njudgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in\\nthe transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 is effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2018 using either of two methods: (i)\\xa0retrospective application of ASU 2014-09 to\\neach prior reporting period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients as defined within ASU 2014-09; or (ii)\\xa0retrospective application of ASU 2014-09 with the cumulative effect of initially applying ASU 2014-09 recognized\\nat the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures as defined per ASU 2014-09. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements. \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n2.\\nACQUISITIONS  Acquisition of MICROS\\nSystems, Inc.  On June\\xa022, 2014, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement) with MICROS Systems, Inc.\\n(MICROS), a provider of integrated software, hardware and services solutions to the hospitality and retail industries. On July\\xa03, 2014, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we commenced a tender offer to purchase all of the issued and outstanding\\nshares of common stock of MICROS at a purchase price of $68.00 per share, net to the holder in cash, without interest thereon, based upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. Between September\\xa03, 2014 and\\nSeptember\\xa08, 2014, pursuant to the terms of the tender offer, we accepted and paid for the substantial majority of outstanding shares of MICROS common stock. On September\\xa08, 2014, we effectuated the merger of MICROS with and into a\\nwholly-owned subsidiary of Oracle pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement and applicable Maryland law and MICROS became an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Oracle. Pursuant to the merger, shares of MICROS common stock that remained\\noutstanding and were not acquired by us were converted into, and cancelled in exchange for, the right to receive $68.00 per share in cash. The unvested equity awards to acquire MICROS common stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the\\nconclusion of the merger were converted into equity awards denominated in shares of Oracle common stock based on formulas contained in the Merger Agreement. We acquired MICROS to, among other things, expand our software and cloud, hardware and\\nrelated services offerings for hotels, food and beverage industries, facilities, and retailers. We have included the financial results of MICROS in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. \\nPursuant to our business combinations accounting policy, we estimated the preliminary fair values of net tangible and intangible assets acquired and the\\nexcess of the consideration transferred over the aggregate of such fair values was recorded as goodwill. The preliminary fair values of net tangible assets and intangible assets acquired were based upon preliminary valuations and our estimates and\\nassumptions are subject to change within the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date).

These acquisitions were not\\nindividually significant. We have included the financial results of the acquired companies in our consolidated financial statements from their respective acquisition dates and the results from each of these companies were not individually material\\nto our consolidated financial statements. In the aggregate, the total preliminary purchase price for these acquisitions was approximately $1.7 billion, which consisted of approximately $1.7 billion in cash and $7 million for the fair values of stock\\noptions and restricted stock-based awards assumed. We have preliminarily recorded $14 million of net tangible assets and $388 million of identifiable intangible assets, based on their estimated fair values, and $1.3 billion of residual goodwill.\\n The initial purchase price calculation and related accounting for our acquisitions completed during fiscal 2015 is preliminary. The\\npreliminary fair value estimates for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for our acquisitions completed during fiscal 2015 were based upon preliminary calculations and valuations and our estimates and assumptions for these acquisitions are\\nsubject to change as we obtain additional information during the respective measurement periods (up to one year from the respective acquisition dates). The primary areas of those preliminary estimates that are not yet finalized relate to certain\\ntangible assets and liabilities acquired, identifiable intangible assets, certain legal matters and income and non-income based taxes. \\nFiscal 2014 Acquisitions \\nAcquisition of Responsys, Inc.  On\\nFebruary\\xa06, 2014, we completed our acquisition of Responsys, Inc. (Responsys), a provider of enterprise-scale cloud-based business-to-consumer marketing software. We have included the financial results of Responsys in our consolidated financial\\nstatements from the date of acquisition. The total purchase price for Responsys was approximately $1.6 billion, which consisted of approximately $1.4 billion in cash and $147 million for the fair values of stock options and restricted stock-based\\nawards assumed. We recorded $32 million of net tangible liabilities, related primarily to deferred tax liabilities, $580 million of identifiable intangible assets, and $14 million of in-process research and development, based on their estimated fair\\nvalues, and $1.0 billion of residual goodwill. \\n \\xa0 105\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2015  \\xa0\\n Other Fiscal 2014 Acquisitions  During fiscal 2014, we acquired certain other companies and purchased certain technology and development assets primarily to expand our products and services offerings.

Other Fiscal 2013 Acquisitions  During fiscal 2013, we acquired certain other companies and purchased certain technology and development assets primarily to expand our products and services offerings. These acquisitions were not\\nsignificant individually or in the aggregate.  Contingent Consideration Related to the Acquisition of Pillar Data Systems, Inc.\\n In fiscal 2012, we acquired Pillar Data Systems, Inc. (Pillar Data), a provider of enterprise storage systems solutions. Pursuant to the\\nagreement and plan of merger dated as of June\\xa029, 2011, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Pillar Data from the stockholders in exchange for Pillar Data\\x92s former stockholders to have rights to receive\\ncontingent cash consideration (Earn-Out), if any, pursuant to an Earn-Out calculation. During fiscal 2013, we estimated that no amount of contingent consideration was to be payable pursuant to the Earn-Out calculation and we recognized a benefit of\\n$387 million. The Earn-Out period ended at the conclusion of our first quarter of fiscal 2015 and no amounts were paid to Pillar Data\\x92s former stockholders, including Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracle\\x92s Executive Chairman of the Board and Chief\\nTechnology Officer and largest stockholder. \\n \\xa0 106\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2015  \\xa0\\n Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information \\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information in the table below summarizes the combined results of operations for Oracle, MICROS, Responsys, and certain\\nother companies that we acquired since the beginning of fiscal 2014 (which were considered relevant for the purposes of unaudited pro forma financial information disclosure) as though the companies were combined as of the beginning of fiscal 2014.\\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information for all periods presented also included the business combination accounting effects resulting from these acquisitions, including our amortization charges from acquired intangible assets (certain of which\\nare preliminary), stock-based compensation charges for unvested stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed, if any, and the related tax effects as though the aforementioned companies were combined as of the beginning of fiscal 2014.

Our investment portfolio is subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. As described above, we limit purchases of marketable debt securities to investment\\ngrade securities, which have high credit ratings and also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. As stated in our investment policy, we are averse to principal loss and seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and\\nmarket risk.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n4.\\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  We perform fair\\nvalue measurements in accordance with ASC 820. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When\\ndetermining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at their fair values, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and consider assumptions that market participants would\\nuse when pricing the assets or liabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance.  ASC 820 establishes a\\nfair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. An asset\\x92s or a liability\\x92s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is\\nbased upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Level 2: inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or\\nliabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or\\nliabilities; or  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Level 3: unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair values of the assets or\\nliabilities. \\n \\xa0 108\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2015  \\xa0\\n Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis \\nOur assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, excluding accrued interest components, consisted of the following (Level 1 and 2\\ninputs are defined above):  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nMay\\xa031, 2015\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nMay\\xa031, 2014\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nFair\\xa0Value\\xa0MeasurementsUsing Input Types\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nFair\\xa0Value\\xa0MeasurementsUsing Input Types\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n (in millions)\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Level\\xa01\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Level\\xa02\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0Total\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Level\\xa01\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Level\\xa02\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0Total\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Assets:\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n U.S. Treasury securities\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n668\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\x97\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n668\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\x97\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\x97\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\x97\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Commercial paper debt securities\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\x97\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n9,203\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n9,203\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\x97\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n7,969\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n7,969\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Corporate debt securities and other\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n190\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n28,654\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n28,844\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n119\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n16,538\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n16,657\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Derivative financial instruments\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\x97\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n74\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n74\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\x97\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n97\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n97\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Total assets\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0858\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa037,931\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa038,789\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0119\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa024,604\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa024,723\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Liabilities:\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Derivative financial instruments\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\x97\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n244\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n244\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\x97\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\x97\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\x97\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n Our valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of our marketable securities that were classified as Level 1 in\\nthe table above were derived from quoted market prices and active markets for these instruments exist.

Goodwill adjustments were not significant to our previously reported operating results or financial position. \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n(3)\\xa0\\n During fiscal 2015, we recorded a $186 million goodwill impairment loss to our hardware systems products reporting unit. We considered several\\napproaches to determine the fair value of our hardware systems reporting unit as of March\\xa01, 2015 and concluded the most appropriate to be the income approach. The fair value of our hardware systems products reporting unit pursuant to the\\nincome approach was impacted by lower forecasted operating results for this reporting unit, primarily caused by lower forecasted revenues and our continued investment in hardware products research and development activities. We compared the implied\\nfair value of goodwill in our hardware systems products reporting unit to its carrying value, which resulted in the $186 million goodwill impairment loss and represented the aggregate amount of goodwill for our hardware systems products reporting\\nunit. The aggregate hardware systems reporting unit goodwill that was impaired in fiscal 2015 resulted from our acquisitions of Pillar Data Systems, Inc., Xsigo Systems, Inc., GreenBytes, Inc. and MICROS Systems, Inc. Such impairment loss was\\nrecorded to acquisition related and other expenses in our fiscal 2015 consolidated statement of operations.

We issued the May 2015 Senior Notes for general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on our common stock\\nand future acquisitions, and repayment of indebtedness.  In July 2014, we issued $10.0 billion of senior notes comprised of $1.0 billion of\\nfloating rate notes due July 2017 (2017 Floating Rate Notes), $750 million of floating rate notes due October 2019 (2019 Floating Rate Notes), $2.0 billion of 2.25% notes due October 2019 (2019 Notes), $1.5 billion of 2.80% notes due July 2021 (2021\\nNotes), $2.0 billion of 3.40% notes due July 2024 (2024 Notes), $1.75 billion of 4.30% notes due July 2034 (2034 Notes) and $1.0 billion of 4.50% notes due July 2044 (2044 Notes and, together with the 2017 Floating Rate Notes, 2019 Floating Rate\\nNotes, 2019 Notes, 2021 Notes, 2024 Notes and 2034 Notes, the July 2014 Senior Notes). The floating rate notes bear interest at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 0.20% for the 2017 Floating Rate Notes and 0.51% for the 2019 Floating\\nRate Notes (0.47% and 0.78% as of May\\xa031, 2015, respectively) with interest payable quarterly. We issued the July 2014 Senior Notes for general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on our common\\nstock, our acquisition of MICROS and future acquisitions, and repayment of indebtedness.  In July 2013, we issued \\x802.0 billion ($2.2\\nbillion and $2.7 billion as of May\\xa031, 2015 and 2014, respectively) of fixed rate senior notes comprised of \\x801.25 billion of 2.25% notes due January 2021 (January 2021 Notes) and \\x80750\\xa0million of 3.125% notes due July 2025 (July\\n2025 Notes, and together with the January 2021 Notes, the Euro Notes). The Euro Notes are registered and trade on the New York Stock Exchange. \\nIn connection with the issuance of the January 2021 Notes, we entered into certain cross-currency swap agreements that have the economic effect of\\nconverting our fixed rate, Euro denominated debt, including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a fixed rate, U.S.\\xa0Dollar denominated debt of $1.6 billion with a fixed annual interest rate of 3.53% (see Note 11\\nfor additional information). Further, we designated the July 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in\\nstockholders\\x92 equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the U.S.\\xa0Dollar (see Note 11 for additional information).  In July 2013, we also issued $3.0 billion of senior notes comprised of $500 million of floating rate notes due January 2019 (January 2019 Floating Rate Notes), $1.5 billion of 2.375% notes due January\\n2019 (January 2019 Notes) and $1.0 billion of 3.625% notes due July 2023 (2023 Notes). The January 2019 Floating Rate Notes bear interest at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 0.58% (0.86% and 0.81% as of May\\xa031, 2015 and 2014,\\nrespectively) with interest payable quarterly.  In October 2012, we issued $5.0 billion of fixed rate senior notes comprised of $2.5 billion of\\n1.20% notes due October 2017 (2017 Notes) and $2.5 billion of 2.50% notes due October 2022 (October 2022 Notes).  In July 2010, we issued $3.25\\nbillion of fixed rate senior notes comprised of $1.0 billion of 3.875% notes due July 2020 (2020 Notes) and $2.25 billion of 5.375% notes due July 2040 (2040 Notes).  In July 2009, we issued $4.5 billion of fixed rate senior notes of which $1.5 billion of 3.75% notes (2014 Notes) was due and paid in July 2014 (we also settled the fixed to variable interest rate swap\\nagreements associated with the 2014 Notes) and $1.75 billion of 5.00% notes due July 2019 (July 2019 Notes) and $1.25 billion of 6.125% notes due July 2039 (2039 Notes) remained outstanding as of May\\xa031, 2015. \\nIn April 2008, we issued $5.0 billion of fixed rate senior notes, of which $1.25 billion of 4.95% senior notes was due and paid in April 2013, and $2.5\\nbillion of 5.75% senior notes due April 2018 (2018 Notes) and $1.25 billion of 6.50% senior notes due April 2038 (2038 Notes) remained outstanding as of May\\xa031, 2015.  In January 2006, we issued $5.75 billion of senior notes, of which $2.0 billion of 5.25% senior notes due January 2016 (2016 Notes) remained outstanding as of May\\xa031, 2015. \\n \\xa0 113\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2015  \\xa0\\n The effective interest yields of the 2016 Notes, 2017 Notes, 2018 Notes, January 2019 Notes, July 2019\\nNotes, 2019 Notes, 2020 Notes, 2021 Notes, 2022 Notes, October 2022 Notes, 2023 Notes, 2024 Notes, 2025 Notes, July 2025 Notes, 2030 Notes, 2034 Notes, 2035 Notes, 2038 Notes, 2039 Notes, 2040 Notes, 2044 Notes, 2045 Notes and 2055 Notes\\n(collectively and together with the January 2021 Notes, the Senior Notes) at May\\xa031, 2015 were 5.32%, 1.24%, 5.76%, 2.44%, 5.05%, 2.27%, 3.93%, 2.82%, 2.56%, 2.51%, 3.73%, 3.43%, 3.00%, 3.17%, 3.30%, 4.30%, 3.95%, 6.52%, 6.19%, 5.45%, 4.50%,\\n4.15%, and 4.40%, respectively. In July 2014 and July 2013, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effects of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with the 2019 Notes, January 2019 Notes and 2021\\nNotes so that the interest payable on these notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR (0.76%, 0.93% and 0.91%, respectively, at May\\xa031, 2015; and 0.88% for the January 2019 Notes at May\\xa031, 2014; see Note 11 for additional\\ninformation). The effective interest yield of the January 2021 Notes was 2.33% (3.53% after the economic effects of the cross-currency swap agreements described above and in Note 11). Interest is payable semi-annually for the Senior Notes except for\\nthe Euro Notes for which interest is payable annually. We may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes of each series prior to their maturity, subject to certain restrictions, and the payment of an applicable make-whole premium in certain instances.\\nThe 2017 Floating Rate Notes, January 2019 Floating Rate Notes and 2019 Floating Rate Notes (collectively the Floating Rate Notes) may not be redeemed prior to their maturity.  The Senior Notes and the Floating Rate Notes rank pari passu with any other notes we may issue in the future pursuant to our commercial paper program (see additional discussion regarding our commercial\\npaper program below) and all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness of Oracle Corporation. All existing and future liabilities of the subsidiaries of Oracle Corporation are or will be effectively senior to the Senior Notes and the\\nFloating Rate Notes and any future issuances of commercial paper notes.

As of May\\xa031, 2015 and 2014, we\\ndid not have any outstanding commercial paper notes. We intend to back-stop any commercial paper notes that we may issue in the future with the 2013 Credit Agreement (see additional details below). \\nRevolving Credit Agreements  In April\\n2013, we entered into a $3.0 billion Revolving Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Bank of America, N.A., BNP Paribas, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and certain other lenders (the 2013 Credit Agreement). The 2013 Credit Agreement provides for\\nan unsecured 5-year revolving credit facility to be used for general corporate purposes including back-stopping any commercial paper notes that we may issue.

Any amounts drawn pursuant to the 2013 Credit Agreement are due on April\\xa020, 2018.\\xa0No amounts were outstanding pursuant to the 2013 Credit Agreement as of May\\xa031, 2015 and\\n2014.  The 2013 Credit Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default, including the\\nrequirement that our total net debt to total capitalization ratio not exceed 45% on a consolidated basis. If any of the events of default occur and are not cured within applicable grace periods or waived, any unpaid amounts under the 2013 Credit\\nAgreement may be declared immediately due and payable and the 2013 Credit Agreement may be terminated. We were in compliance with the 2013 Credit Agreement\\x92s covenants as of May\\xa031, 2015. \\nOn May\\xa029, 2012, we borrowed $1.7 billion pursuant to a revolving credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as initial lender and\\nadministrative agent; and J.P.

During fiscal 2013, we repaid the $1.7 billion and the 2012 Credit Agreement expired pursuant to its terms. \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n9.\\nRESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES  Fiscal 2015\\nOracle Restructuring Plan  During the second quarter of fiscal 2015, our management approved, committed to and initiated plans to\\nrestructure and further improve efficiencies in our operations due to our acquisition of MICROS and certain other operational activities (2015 Restructuring Plan). The total estimated restructuring costs associated with the 2015 Restructuring Plan\\nare up to $626 million and will be recorded to the restructuring expense line item within our consolidated statements of operations as they are incurred. We recorded $100 million of restructuring expenses in connection with the 2015 Restructuring\\nPlan in fiscal 2015 and we expect to incur the majority of the estimated remaining $526 million through the end of fiscal 2016.

Deferred cloud software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) revenues generally result from customer payments\\nmade in advance for our cloud-based offerings that are recognized over the corresponding contractual term. Deferred new software licenses revenues typically result from undelivered products or specified enhancements, customer specific acceptance\\nprovisions, customer payments made in advance for time-based license arrangements and software license transactions that cannot be separated from undelivered consulting or other services.  In connection with our acquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the cloud SaaS and PaaS, software license updates and product support, and hardware systems support obligations, among others,\\nassumed from our acquired companies. We generally have estimated the fair values of these obligations assumed using a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the\\nobligations plus a normal profit margin. The sum of the costs and operating profit approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume these acquired obligations. These aforementioned fair value adjustments\\nrecorded for obligations assumed from our acquisitions reduced the cloud SaaS and PaaS, software license updates and product support and hardware systems support deferred revenues balances that we recorded as liabilities from these acquisitions and\\nalso reduced the resulting revenues that we recognized or will recognize over the terms of the acquired obligations during the post-combination periods.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n11.\\nDERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  Fair\\nValue Hedges\\x97Interest Rate Swap Agreements  In July 2014, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the\\neconomic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with our 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes so that the interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. In July 2013, we entered into certain interest\\nrate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with our January 2019 Notes so that the interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. The critical terms\\nof the interest rate swap agreements match the critical terms of the 2019 Notes, 2021 Notes and the January 2019 Notes that the interest rate swap agreements pertain to, including the notional amounts and maturity dates. \\nWe have designated the aforementioned interest rate swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for them as fair value hedges\\npursuant to ASC 815. These transactions are characterized as fair value hedges for financial accounting purposes because they protect us against changes in the fair values of certain of our fixed rate borrowings due to benchmark interest rate\\nmovements. The changes in fair values of these interest rate swap agreements are recognized as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amounts included in other assets or other non-current liabilities in\\nour consolidated balance sheets. The amount of net gain (loss) attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amount included in notes payable, non-current.\\nThe periodic interest settlements for the interest rate swap agreements for the 2019 Notes, 2021 Notes and the January 2019 Notes are recorded as interest expense and are included as a part of cash flows from operating activities. \\nIn July 2014, we settled the fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements associated with the 2014 Notes.\\xa0We do not use any interest rate swap\\nagreements for trading purposes.  Cash Flow Hedges\\x97Cross Currency Swap Agreements \\nIn connection with the issuance of our January 2021 Notes, we entered into certain cross-currency swap agreements to manage the related foreign currency\\nexchange risk by effectively converting the fixed-rate, Euro denominated January 2021 Notes, including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to fixed-rate, U.S.\\xa0Dollar denominated debt. The economic effect of\\nthe swap agreements was to eliminate the uncertainty of the cash flows in U.S. Dollars associated with the January 2021 Notes by fixing the \\n \\xa0 118\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2015  \\xa0\\n \\nprincipal amount of the January 2021 Notes at $1.6 billion with a fixed annual interest rate of 3.53%. We have designated these cross-currency swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments\\nand are accounting for these as cash flow hedges pursuant to ASC 815. The critical terms of the cross-currency swap agreements correspond to the January 2021 Notes, including the annual interest payments being hedged, and the cross-currency swap\\nagreements mature at the same time as the January 2021 Notes.  We used the hypothetical derivative method to measure the effectiveness of our\\ncross-currency swap agreements. The fair values of these cross-currency swap agreements are recognized as other assets or other non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The effective portions of the changes in fair values of these\\ncross-currency swap agreements are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets and an amount is reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss into non-operating income (expense), net in the same\\nperiod that the carrying value of the Euro denominated January 2021 Notes is remeasured and the interest expense is recognized. The ineffective portion of the unrealized gains and losses on these cross-currency swaps, if any, is recorded immediately\\nto non-operating income (expense), net. We evaluate the effectiveness of our cross-currency swap agreements on a quarterly basis. We did not record any ineffectiveness for fiscal 2015 or 2014. The cash flows related to the cross-currency swap\\nagreements that pertain to the periodic interest settlements are classified as operating activities and the cash flows that pertain to the principal balance are classified as financing activities. \\nWe do not use any cross-currency swap agreements for trading purposes.  Net Investment Hedge\\x97Foreign Currency Borrowings  In July 2013, we designated\\nour July 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholders\\x92 equity caused by the changes in\\nforeign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the U.S. Dollar.  We used the spot method to measure the effectiveness of our net\\ninvestment hedge. Under this method, for each reporting period, the change in the carrying value of the Euro denominated July 2025 Notes due to remeasurement of the effective portion is reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our\\nconsolidated balance sheet and the remaining change in the carrying value of the ineffective portion, if any, is recognized in non-operating income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations. We evaluate the effectiveness of our net\\ninvestment hedge at the beginning of every quarter. We did not record any ineffectiveness for fiscal 2015 or 2014.  Foreign Currency\\nForward Contracts Not Designated as Hedges  We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that\\nprimarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or\\ndecreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions. We may suspend this program from\\ntime to time. Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees, intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions that are generally expected to be cash settled in the near term. Our foreign currency forward\\ncontracts are generally short-term in duration. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency exposures that we enter into, the currency exchange rates\\nassociated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized and unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors. \\n \\xa0 119\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2015  \\xa0\\n We neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these\\nforward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815. Accordingly, we recorded the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair values recorded to our\\nconsolidated statement of operations. The balance sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is prepaid expenses and other current assets for a net unrealized gain position and other current liabilities for a net unrealized\\nloss position. The statement of operations classification for changes in fair values of these forward contracts is non-operating income (expense), net, for both realized and unrealized gains and losses. \\nAs of May\\xa031, 2015 and 2014, respectively, the notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major\\ninternational currencies were $2.2 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively, and the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $1.2 billion and $2.0 billion,\\nrespectively. The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal at May\\xa031, 2015 and 2014.  Included in\\nour non-operating income (expense), net were $60 million, $(69) million and $(64) million of net gains (losses) related to these forward contracts for the years ended May\\xa031, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

We have approximately $61 million in facility obligations, net of estimated sublease income and other costs, in accrued restructuring for these locations in our consolidated balance sheet at\\nMay\\xa031, 2015.  Rent expense was $290 million, $278 million and $313 million for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, net of sublease\\nincome of approximately $45 million, $55 million and $69 million, respectively. Certain lease agreements contain renewal options providing for extensions of the lease terms.  Unconditional Obligations  In the ordinary course of business, we enter into certain\\nunconditional purchase obligations with our suppliers, which are agreements that are enforceable, legally binding and specify terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the\\napproximate timing of the payment. We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for our hardware products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished hardware products. We also obtain individual components for\\nour hardware systems products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within\\nagreed upon lead-times and/or commercially standard lead-times for the particular part or product and have been included in the amounts below. Routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to our external manufacturers and\\ncertain other suppliers and that are entered into in the ordinary course of business are not included in the amounts below as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are difficult to quantify in a\\nmeaningful way. \\n \\xa0 121\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2015  \\xa0\\n As of May\\xa031, 2015, our unconditional purchase and certain other obligations were as follows (in\\nmillions):  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Fiscal 2016\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n 713\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Fiscal 2017\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n195\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Fiscal 2018\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n124\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Fiscal 2019\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n85\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Fiscal 2020\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n64\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Thereafter\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\x97\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Total\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa01,181\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n As described in Note 8 and Note 11 above, as of May\\xa031, 2015 we have senior notes of $42.0 billion that mature at\\nvarious future dates and derivative financial instruments outstanding that we leverage to manage certain risks and exposures.  Guarantees\\n Our software, cloud and hardware systems product sales agreements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against\\nliabilities if our products infringe a third party\\x92s intellectual property rights. To date, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications and have not accrued any material liabilities related to such obligations\\nin our consolidated financial statements. Certain of our product sales agreements also include provisions indemnifying customers against liabilities in the event we breach confidentiality or service level requirements. It is not possible to\\ndetermine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to our limited and infrequent history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. \\nOur software license and hardware systems products agreements also generally include a warranty that our products will substantially operate as described\\nin the applicable program documentation for a period of one year after delivery. Our software as a service, platform as a service and infrastructure as a service agreements generally include a warranty that the cloud services will be performed in\\nall material respects as defined in the agreement during the service period. We also warrant that services we perform will be provided in a manner consistent with industry standards for a period of 90 days from performance of the services.\\n We occasionally are required, for various reasons, to enter into\\xa0financial guarantees with third parties in\\xa0the ordinary course of\\nour business\\xa0including, among others,\\xa0guarantees related to foreign exchange trades, taxes, import licenses and letters of credit on behalf of parties with whom we conduct business.

On September\\xa018, 2014, we announced that our Board of Directors approved an expansion of our stock repurchase program by an additional\\n$13.0\\xa0billion. Approximately $9.2 billion remained available for stock repurchases as of May\\xa031, 2015, pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 193.7\\xa0million shares for $8.1 billion (including 2.2\\xa0million shares\\nfor $95 million that were repurchased but not settled), 280.4\\xa0million shares for $9.8 billion and 346.1\\xa0million shares for $11.0 billion in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, under the stock repurchase program. \\nOur stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working\\ncapital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchase of our debt, our stock price, and economic and market \\n \\xa0 122\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2015  \\xa0\\n \\nconditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended,\\ndelayed or discontinued at any time.  Dividends on Common Stock  During fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, our Board of Directors declared cash dividends of $0.51, $0.48 and $0.30 per share of our outstanding common stock, respectively, which we paid during the same period.\\n In June 2015, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share of our outstanding common stock payable on\\nJuly\\xa029, 2015 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July\\xa08, 2015.

In fiscal 2011, our stockholders, upon the recommendation of our Board of Directors (the Board), approved the adoption of the Amended and\\nRestated 2000 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the 2000 Plan), which extended the termination date of the 2000 Plan by ten years and increased the number of authorized shares of stock that may be issued by 388,313,015 shares. In fiscal 2014, our\\nstockholders, upon the recommendation of our Board, approved a further increase in the number of authorized shares of stock that may be issued under the 2000 Plan by 305,000,000 shares.  Under the terms of the 2000 Plan, options to purchase common stock are granted at not less than fair market value, become exercisable as established by the Compensation Committee of the Board (generally\\n25% annually over four years under our current practice) and generally expire no more than ten years from the date of grant. Long-term full value awards are granted in the form of restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance stock units (PSUs). The\\nvesting schedule for RSUs is established by the Compensation Committee and generally requires vesting 25% annually over four years. The vesting schedule for PSUs is also established by the Compensation Committee and currently requires vesting over\\nfour fiscal years, if at all, based on relative performance. For each share granted as a full value award under the 2000 Plan, an equivalent of 2.5 shares is deducted from our pool of shares available for grant. As of May\\xa031, 2015, the 2000\\nPlan had stock options to purchase 401\\xa0million shares of common stock outstanding of which 215\\xa0million shares were vested, 24\\xa0million unvested RSUs outstanding and \\n \\xa0 123\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2015  \\xa0\\n \\n3\\xa0million unvested PSUs outstanding. As of May\\xa031, 2015, approximately 409\\xa0million shares of common stock were available for future awards under the 2000 Plan. To date, we have not\\nissued any stock purchase rights or stock appreciation rights under the 2000 Plan.  In fiscal 1993, the Board adopted the 1993 Directors\\x92\\nStock Plan (the Directors\\x92 Plan), which provides for the issuance of non-qualified stock options and other stock-based awards, including RSUs, to non-employee directors. The Directors\\x92 Plan has from time to time been amended and restated.\\nUnder the terms of the Directors\\x92 Plan, 10\\xa0million shares of common stock are reserved for issuance (including a fiscal 2013 amendment to increase the number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance by 2\\xa0million shares).\\nOptions are granted at not less than fair market value, vest over four years, and expire no more than ten years from the date of grant. RSUs granted under the Directors\\x92 Plan also vest over four years. The Directors\\x92 Plan provides for\\nautomatic grants of stock awards to each non-employee director upon first becoming a director and thereafter on an annual basis, as well as automatic nondiscretionary grants for chairing or vice chairing certain Board committees. The Board will\\ndetermine the particular terms of any such stock awards at the time of grant, but the terms will be consistent with those of stock awards granted under the Directors\\x92 Plan with respect to vesting or forfeiture schedules and treatment on\\ntermination of status as a director. As of May\\xa031, 2015, options to purchase approximately 4\\xa0million shares of common stock (of which approximately 2\\xa0million were vested) and 64,000 unvested RSUs were outstanding under the 1993\\nDirectors\\x92 Plan. As of May\\xa031, 2015, approximately 2\\xa0million shares were available for future stock awards under this plan.  In\\nconnection with certain of our acquisitions, we assumed certain outstanding stock options and other restricted stock-based awards under each acquired company\\x92s respective stock plans. These stock options and other restricted stock-based awards\\ngenerally retain all of the rights, terms and conditions of the respective plans under which they were originally granted. As of May\\xa031, 2015, stock options to purchase 8\\xa0million shares of common stock and 1\\xa0million shares of\\nrestricted stock-based awards were outstanding under these plans.

The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised and vesting of restricted stock-based awards was $1.3 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In connection with these exercises\\nand vesting of restricted stock-based awards, the tax benefits realized by us were $396 million, $480 million and $410 million for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Of the total tax benefits received, we classified excess tax benefits from\\nstock-based compensation of $244 million, $250 million and $241 million as cash flows from financing activities rather than cash flows from operating activities for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. \\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan  We\\nhave an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (Purchase Plan) that allows employees to purchase shares of common stock at a price per share that is 95% of the fair market value of Oracle stock as of the end of the semi-annual option period. As of\\nMay\\xa031, 2015, 57\\xa0million shares were reserved for future issuances under the Purchase Plan. We issued 3\\xa0million shares under the Purchase Plan in each of fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013. \\nDefined Contribution and Other Postretirement Plans  We offer various defined contribution plans for our U.S. and non-U.S. employees. Total defined contribution plan expense was $362 million, $357 million and $353 million for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013,\\nrespectively. The number of plan participants in our benefit plans has generally increased in recent years primarily as a result of additional eligible employees from our acquisitions.  In the United States, regular employees can participate in the Oracle Corporation 401(k) Savings and Investment Plan (Oracle 401(k) Plan). Participants can generally contribute up to 40% of their eligible\\ncompensation on a per-pay-period basis as defined by the Oracle 401(k) Plan document or by the section 402(g) limit as defined by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS). We match a portion of employee contributions, currently 50% up to 6%\\nof compensation each pay period, subject to maximum aggregate matching amounts. Our contributions to the Oracle 401(k) Plan, net of forfeitures, were $144 million, $134 million and $129 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\\n We also offer non-qualified deferred compensation plans to certain key employees whereby they may defer a portion of their annual base and/or\\nvariable compensation until retirement or a date specified by the employee in accordance with the plans. Deferred compensation plan assets and liabilities were each approximately $408 million as of May\\xa031, 2015 and were each approximately $367\\nmillion as of May\\xa031, 2014 and were presented in other assets and other non-current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  We sponsor certain defined benefit pension plans that are offered primarily by certain of our foreign subsidiaries. Many of these plans were assumed through our acquisitions or are required by local\\nregulatory requirements. We may deposit funds for these plans with insurance companies, third party trustees, or into government-managed accounts consistent with local regulatory requirements, as applicable. Our total defined benefit plan pension\\nexpenses were $69 million, $64 million and $81 million for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The aggregate projected benefit obligation and aggregate net liability (funded status) of our defined benefit plans as of May\\xa031, 2015 was $1.0\\nbillion and $599 million, respectively, and as of May\\xa031, 2014 was $853 million and $436 million, respectively. \\n \\xa0 127\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

on the undistributed earnings and the other outside basis temporary differences\\nof foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. At May\\xa031, 2015, the amount of temporary differences related to undistributed earnings and other outside basis temporary differences of\\ninvestments in foreign subsidiaries upon which United States income taxes have not been provided was approximately $38.0 billion and $8.4 billion, respectively. If these undistributed earnings were repatriated to the United States, or if the other\\noutside basis differences were recognized in a taxable transaction, they would generate foreign tax credits that would reduce the federal tax liability associated with the foreign dividend or the otherwise taxable transaction. At May\\xa031, 2015,\\nassuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits, the potential net deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences of undistributed earnings and other outside basis temporary differences would be approximately $11.8 billion\\nand $2.7 billion, respectively.  Our net deferred tax assets were $993 million and $1.4 billion as of May\\xa031, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\\nWe believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generation of sufficient taxable income in future years in\\nappropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future\\nperiods if estimates of future taxable income change. \\n \\xa0 129\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2015  \\xa0\\n The valuation allowance was $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion at May\\xa031, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\\nSubstantially all of the valuation allowances as of May\\xa031, 2015 and 2014 relate to tax assets established in purchase accounting. Any subsequent reduction of that portion of the valuation allowance and the recognition of the associated tax\\nbenefits associated with our acquisitions will be recorded to our provision for income taxes subsequent to our final determination of the valuation allowance or the conclusion of the measurement period (as defined above), whichever comes first.\\n At May\\xa031, 2015, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $958 million. These losses expire in various years\\nbetween fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2034, and are subject to limitations on their utilization. We had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $2.9 billion at May\\xa031, 2015, which expire between fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2034, and are\\nsubject to limitations on their utilization. We had total foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1.6 billion at May\\xa031, 2015, which are subject to limitations on their utilization. Approximately $1.4 billion of these foreign\\nnet operating losses are not currently subject to expiration dates. The remainder of the foreign net operating losses, approximately $216 million, expire between fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2035. We had tax credit carryforwards of approximately $904\\nmillion at May\\xa031, 2015, which are subject to limitations on their utilization. Approximately $573 million of these tax credit carryforwards are not currently subject to expiration dates. The remainder of the tax credit carryforwards,\\napproximately $331 million, expire in various years between fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2034.

We recognized interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our provision for income taxes line of our consolidated statements of operations of $102 million, $24 million and\\n$31 million during fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Interest and penalties accrued as of May\\xa031, 2015 and 2014 were $756 million and $693 million, respectively.  Domestically, U.S. federal and state taxing authorities are currently examining income tax returns of Oracle and various acquired entities for years through fiscal 2013. Many issues are at an advanced\\nstage in the examination process, the most significant of which include the deductibility of certain royalty payments, transfer pricing, extraterritorial income exemptions, domestic production activity, foreign tax credits, and research and\\ndevelopment credits taken. Other issues are related to years with expiring statutes of limitation. With all of these domestic audit issues considered in the aggregate, we believe it was reasonably possible that, as of May\\xa031, 2015, the gross\\nunrecognized tax benefits related to these audits could decrease (whether by payment, release, or a combination of both) in the next 12 months by as much as $426 million ($358 million net of offsetting tax benefits). Our U.S. federal and, with some\\nexceptions, our state income tax returns have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2003 and we are no longer subject to audit for those periods. \\n \\xa0 130\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2015  \\xa0\\n Internationally, tax authorities for numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions are also examining returns\\naffecting our unrecognized tax benefits. We believe it was reasonably possible that, as of May\\xa031, 2015, the gross unrecognized tax benefits, could decrease (whether by payment, release, or a combination of both) by as much as $172 million ($86\\nmillion net of offsetting tax benefits) in the next 12 months, related primarily to transfer pricing. Other issues are related to years with expiring statutes of limitation. With some exceptions, we are generally no longer subject to tax\\nexaminations in non-U.S. jurisdictions for years prior to fiscal 1997.  We believe that we have adequately provided under U.S. GAAP for\\noutcomes related to our tax audits. However, there can be no assurances as to the possible outcomes or any attendant financial statement effect thereof.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n16.\\nSEGMENT INFORMATION  ASC 280, Segment\\nReporting, establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief\\noperating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our chief operating decision makers are our Chief Executive Officers. We are organized geographically and by line of business.\\nWhile our Chief Executive Officers evaluate results in a number of different ways, the line of business management structure is the primary basis for which the allocation of resources and financial results are assessed. \\nWe have three businesses\\x97software and cloud, hardware systems and services\\x97which are further divided into certain operating segments. Our\\nsoftware and cloud business is comprised of three operating segments: (1)\\xa0new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions, which includes our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings, (2)\\xa0cloud infrastructure as a service and (3)\\xa0software\\nlicense updates and product support. Our hardware systems business is comprised of two operating segments: (1)\\xa0hardware systems products and (2)\\xa0hardware systems support. All other operating segments are combined under our services\\nbusiness.  Our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions line of business markets, sells and delivers our application and platform\\ntechnologies, including our SaaS and PaaS offerings (our SaaS and PaaS offerings are collectively referred to as cloud software subscriptions), which provide customers a choice of software applications and platforms that are delivered via a\\ncloud-based IT environment that we host, manage and support, and the licensing of our software products including Oracle Applications, Oracle Database, Oracle Fusion Middleware and Java, among others. \\nThe cloud infrastructure as a service line of business provides comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services for customer IT\\ninfrastructure for a fee for a stated term that is hosted at our Oracle data center facilities, select partner data centers or physically on-premises at customer facilities; deployment and management offerings for our software and hardware and\\nrelated IT infrastructure including virtual machine instances that are subscription-based and designed for computing and reliable and secure object storage; and certain of our Oracle Engineered Systems and related support offerings that are deployed\\nin our customers\\x92 data centers for a monthly fee.  The software license updates and product support line of business provides customers\\nwith rights to software product upgrades and maintenance releases, patches released, internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel during the support period. \\nThe hardware systems products line of business provides Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, networking, industry specific hardware,\\nvirtualization software, operating systems including the Oracle Solaris Operating System and management software to support diverse IT environments, including cloud computing environments.  Our hardware systems support line of business provides customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products, such as Oracle Solaris\\nand certain other software products, and can include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. \\n \\xa0 131\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May 31, 2015  \\xa0\\n Our services business is comprised of the remainder of our operating segments and offers consulting,\\nadvanced customer support services and education services.

The\\ncomplaint alleged that when Oracle announced on March\\xa022 and 23, 2011 that it would no longer develop future versions of its software to run on HP\\x92s Itanium-based servers, it breached a settlement agreement signed on September\\xa020,\\n2010 between HP and Mark Hurd (the \\x93Hurd Settlement Agreement\\x94), who was both HP\\x92s former chief executive officer and chairman of HP\\x92s board of directors. HP sought a judicial declaration of the parties\\x92 rights and\\nobligations under the Hurd Settlement Agreement, and other equitable and monetary relief.  Oracle answered the complaint and filed a\\ncross-complaint, which was amended on December\\xa02, 2011. The amended cross-complaint alleged claims including violation of the Lanham Act. Oracle alleged that HP had secretly agreed to pay Intel to continue to develop and manufacture the Itanium\\nmicroprocessor, and had misrepresented to customers that the Itanium microprocessor had a long roadmap, among other claims. Oracle sought equitable rescission of the Hurd Settlement Agreement, and other equitable and monetary relief. \\nThe court bifurcated the trial and tried HP\\x92s causes of action for declaratory relief and promissory estoppel without a jury in June 2012. The court\\nissued a final statement of decision on August\\xa028, 2012, finding that the Hurd Settlement Agreement required Oracle to continue to develop certain of its software products for use on HP\\x92s Itanium-based servers and to port such products at\\nno cost to HP for as long as HP sells those servers. Oracle has announced that it is appealing this decision. The issues of breach, HP\\x92s performance, causation and damages, HP\\x92s tort claims, and Oracle\\x92s cross-claims will all be tried\\nbefore a jury. As of April\\xa08, 2013, the trial is stayed pending Oracle\\x92s appeal of the court\\x92s denial of its anti-SLAPP motion, which is fully briefed, although oral argument has not yet been scheduled. We cannot currently estimate a\\nreasonably possible range of loss for this action. We believe that we have meritorious defenses against this action, and we will continue to vigorously defend it.  SAP Intellectual Property Litigation  On March\\xa022, 2007, Oracle Corporation, Oracle\\nUSA, Inc. and Oracle International Corporation (collectively, Oracle) filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against SAP AG, its wholly-owned subsidiary, SAP America, Inc., and its wholly-owned\\nsubsidiary, TomorrowNow, Inc., (the SAP Subsidiary, and collectively, the SAP Defendants) alleging that SAP unlawfully accessed Oracle\\x92s Customer Connection support website and improperly took and used Oracle\\x92s intellectual property.\\n After lengthy judicial proceedings, including a jury verdict in Oracle\\x92s favor, on August\\xa02, 2012, Oracle and the SAP Defendants\\nstipulated to a judgment of $306 million against the SAP Defendants. We recorded a $306 million receivable in our consolidated balance sheet and we recognized a corresponding benefit to our results of operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2013.\\nAfter further proceedings, including an appeal, on November\\xa014, 2014, final judgment was entered in Oracle\\x92s favor in the amount of $356.7 million plus post-judgment interest of approximately $2.5 million. During the second quarter of\\nfiscal 2015, Oracle received the total payment of approximately $359.2 million, of which $306 million was applied against the receivable recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 and the excess of $53 million was recorded as a benefit to our\\nresults of operations. This action is now concluded.  Other Litigation  We are party to various other legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, which arise in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings and claims that relate to acquisitions we\\nhave completed or to companies we have acquired or are attempting to acquire.

Our offerings include Oracle database and middleware software, application software, cloud infrastructure, hardware systems\\x97including computer server, storage and networking\\nproducts\\x97and related services. We develop and maintain our products and services to be enterprise-grade, reliable, secure and interoperable while offering customers a choice in deployment models that best meet their information technology (IT)\\nneeds. Our customers can subscribe to use many Oracle software and hardware products through our Oracle Cloud offerings, or purchase our software and hardware products and related services to build their own internal clouds or on-premise IT\\nenvironments.  Cloud computing IT environments, including those offered through our Oracle Cloud Software-as-a-Service (SaaS),\\nPlatform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) offerings, are designed to be attractive and cost-effective options for our customers as we integrate the software and hardware on the customers\\x92 behalf in IT environments that\\nwe deploy, support and manage. We are a leader in the core technologies of cloud computing, including database and middleware software as well as web-based applications, virtualization, clustering, large-scale systems management and related\\ninfrastructure. Our products and services are the building blocks of our own cloud services, our partners\\x92 cloud services and our customers\\x92 cloud IT environments. An important element of our corporate strategy is to deliver reliable,\\nsecure and scalable products and services that are built upon industry standards and are engineered to work both together or independently, regardless of the deployment model selected.  We believe that our investments in, and continued innovation with respect to, our software and cloud, hardware, and services businesses are the foundation of our long-term strategic plans. In fiscal 2014,\\n2013, and 2012 we invested $5.2 billion, $4.9 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively, in research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of products and services and to develop new products and services. We have expanded our\\nenterprise-grade cloud computing offerings through our continued investments in research and development and through targeted acquisitions in order to broaden our Oracle Cloud offerings. For example, our Oracle Cloud Software-as-a-Service offerings,\\nincluding our sales, marketing, customer service, financials, project management, human capital and talent management cloud solutions, among others, enable us to provide IT functionality that customers can use to manage critical business functions\\nin a rapidly deployable delivery model with lower upfront customer investment. Certain of our enterprise-grade cloud computing offerings include infrastructure based upon our Oracle Engineered Systems, including our Oracle Exadata Database Machine,\\nOracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud and Oracle SuperCluster products, among others. We designed our Oracle Engineered Systems to combine certain of our hardware and software offerings to increase computing performance relative to our competitors\\x92\\nproducts, creating cost efficiencies, time savings and operational cost advantages for our customers. Our Oracle Engineered Systems provide the core infrastructure for our own on-premise IT data centers and those of our customers, and for cloud IT\\nenvironments, including our own Oracle Cloud services, our partners\\x92 cloud services and our customers\\x92 cloud environments. We also continue to demonstrate our commitment to customer choice through ongoing enhancements to our Oracle\\nE-Business Suite, Siebel, PeopleSoft and JD Edwards application software products and services, amongst others.  We believe that an active\\nacquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy as it enhances the products and services that we can offer to customers, expands our customer base, provides greater scale to accelerate innovation, grows our revenues and\\nearnings and increases stockholder value. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of companies, products, services and technologies that add to, are complementary to, or have otherwise enhanced our existing\\nofferings. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies to further our corporate strategy.  Our software and\\ncloud, hardware systems, and services businesses are divided into certain operating segments. Our software and cloud business is comprised of three operating segments: (1)\\xa0new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions, which includes\\nour SaaS and PaaS offerings, (2)\\xa0cloud infrastructure-as-a-service and (3)\\xa0software license updates and product support. Our hardware systems business is comprised of two operating \\n \\xa0 3 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nsegments: (1)\\xa0hardware systems products and (2)\\xa0hardware systems support.

This design provides us with an ability to combine Oracle Solaris with our own\\nhardware components to achieve certain performance and efficiency advantages in comparison with our competitors. The Oracle Solaris operating system is based on the UNIX operating system, but is unique among UNIX systems in that it is available on\\nour SPARC servers and x86 servers. We also support Oracle Solaris deployed on other companies\\x92 hardware products.  The Oracle Linux\\noperating system with Oracle\\x92s Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel is a Linux operating system for enterprise workloads including databases, middleware and applications. Oracle\\x92s Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel is designed to work well with Oracle\\nproducts and enables users to patch core operating systems without downtime.  Oracle provides a broad portfolio of virtualization solutions\\nfrom the desktop to the data center. Oracle VM is server virtualization software for both Oracle SPARC and x86 servers and supports both Oracle and non-Oracle applications. Oracle VM software is designed to enable different applications to share a\\nsingle physical system for higher utilization and efficiency and simplify software deployment by enabling pre-configured software images to be created and rapidly deployed without installation or configuration errors. In addition, Oracle Solaris 11\\nprovides comprehensive, built-in virtualization capabilities for both SPARC and x86 servers, networking and storage resources.  In addition to\\nOracle Solaris and Oracle Linux operating systems and Oracle\\x92s virtualization software, we also develop a range of other hardware-related software, including development tools, compilers, management tools for servers and storage, diagnostic\\ntools and file systems.  Hardware Systems Support  Our hardware systems support offerings provide customers with software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our server and storage products, such as Oracle Solaris\\nand certain other software products, and can include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. We continue to evolve hardware systems support processes that are intended to proactively identify and solve quality issues\\nand to increase the amount of hardware systems support contracts sold and renewed in connection with the sales of our hardware systems products. Hardware systems support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware systems\\nproducts fees. Our hardware systems support revenues represented 6% of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2014 and 2013 and 7% in fiscal 2012.  Services Business   We offer services solutions\\nto help customers and partners maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle technology. Our services are differentiated based on our focus on Oracle technology, extensive experience and broad set of intellectual property and best\\npractices. Our services business represented 10% of our total revenues in fiscal 2014 and 11% in each of fiscal 2013 and 2012. Our services business, which is comprised of the remainder of our operating segments, offers: \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n consulting services that are designed to help our customers and global system integrator partners more successfully architect and deploy our products\\nincluding IT strategy alignment, enterprise architecture planning and design, initial product implementation and integration, and ongoing product enhancements and upgrades. We utilize a global, blended delivery model to optimize value for our\\ncustomers and partners, consisting of on-premise consultants from local geographies, industry specialists and consultants from our global delivery and solution centers; \\n \\xa0 13 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n advanced customer support services, which are provided on-premise and remotely to our customers to enable increased performance and higher availability\\nof their Oracle products and services; and  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n education services for Oracle products and services, including training and certification programs that are offered to customers, partners and\\nemployees through a variety of formats, including instructor-led classes at our education centers, live virtual training, self-paced online training, private events and custom training. \\nMarketing and Sales  We directly market\\nand sell our products and services to businesses of many sizes and in many industries, government agencies and educational institutions. We also market and sell our products through indirect channels. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of\\nour total revenues in fiscal 2014, 2013 or 2012.  In the United States, our sales and services employees are based in our headquarters and in\\nfield offices throughout the country. Outside the United States, our international subsidiaries sell, support and service our products in their local countries as well as within other foreign countries where we do not operate through a direct sales\\nsubsidiary. Our geographic coverage allows us to draw on business and technical expertise from a global workforce, provides stability to our operations and revenue streams to offset geography-specific economic trends and offers us an opportunity to\\ntake advantage of new markets for our products. Our international operations subject us to certain risks, which are more fully described in \\x93Risk Factors\\x94 included in Item\\xa01A of this Annual Report. A summary of our domestic and\\ninternational revenues and long-lived assets is set forth in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.  We also market our products worldwide through indirect channels. The companies that comprise our indirect channel network are members of the Oracle Partner Network. The Oracle Partner Network is a global\\nprogram that manages our business relationships with a large, broad-based network of companies, including independent software and hardware vendors, system integrators and resellers that deliver innovative solutions and services based upon our\\nproduct offerings. By offering our partners access to our product offerings, educational information, technical services, marketing and sales support, the Oracle Partner Network program extends our market reach by providing our partners with the\\nresources they need to be successful in delivering solutions to customers globally. The majority of our hardware systems products are sold through indirect channels including independent distributors and value added resellers. \\nSeasonality and Cyclicality  Our\\nquarterly revenues have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including the structure of our sales force incentive compensation plans, which are common in the technology industry. Our total revenues and operating margins are\\ntypically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fiscal quarter. The operating margins of our businesses are generally affected by seasonal factors in a similar manner as our revenues (in particular, our new software licenses\\nand cloud software subscriptions segment) as certain expenses within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short term. See \\x93Selected Quarterly Financial Data\\x94 in Item\\xa07 of this Annual Report for a more complete description of\\nthe seasonality and cyclicality of our revenues, expenses and margins.  Competition \\nWe face intense competition in all aspects of our business. The nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as\\nfirms emerge, expand or are acquired, as technology evolves and as customer demands and competitive pressures otherwise change.  Our customers\\nare demanding less complexity and lower total cost in the implementation, sourcing, integration and ongoing maintenance of their enterprise software and hardware systems. Our enterprise software and cloud and hardware offerings compete directly with\\nsome offerings from some of the largest and most competitive companies in the world, including Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft), International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), Intel, Hewlett-Packard Company (HP) and SAP AG and smaller companies\\nlike salesforce.com, inc. and Workday, Inc., as well as many others. In addition, due to the low barriers to entry in \\n \\xa0 14 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nmany of our market segments, new technologies and new and growing competitors frequently emerge to challenge our offerings. Our competitors range from companies offering broad IT solutions across\\nmany of our lines of business to vendors providing point solutions, or offerings focused on a specific functionality, product area or industry. In addition, as we expand into new market segments, we will face increased competition as we will compete\\nwith existing competitors, as well as firms that may be partners in other areas of our business and other firms with whom we have not previously competed like Amazon.com, Inc. Moreover, we or our competitors may take certain strategic\\nactions\\x97including acquisitions, partnerships and joint ventures, or repositioning of product lines\\x97which invite even greater competition in one or more product categories.  Key competitive factors in each of the segments in which we currently compete and may compete in the future include: total cost of ownership, performance, scalability, reliability, security,\\nfunctionality, efficiency, ease of management and quality of technical support. Our product and service sales (and the relative strength of our products and services versus those of our competitors) are also directly and indirectly affected by the\\nfollowing, among other things:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the adoption of cloud based IT offerings including software-as-a-service, platform-as-a-service and infrastructure-as-a-service offerings;\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the adoption of commodity servers and microprocessors; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the broader \\x93platform\\x94 competition between our industry standard Java technology platform and the .NET programming environment of Microsoft;\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n operating system competition among our Oracle Solaris and Linux operating systems, with alternatives including Microsoft\\x92s Windows Server, and\\nother UNIX and Linux operating systems;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the adoption of open source alternatives to commercial software by enterprise software customers; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n products, features and functionality developed internally by customers and their IT staff; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n products, features or functionality customized and implemented for customers by consultants, systems integrators or other third parties; and\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n attractiveness of offerings from business processing outsourcers.  For more information about the competitive risks we face, refer to Item\\xa01A. \\x93Risk Factors\\x94 included elsewhere in this Annual Report. \\nManufacturing  To produce our hardware\\nproducts, we rely on both our internal manufacturing operations as well as third party manufacturing partners. Our internal manufacturing operations consist primarily of materials procurement, assembly, testing and quality control of our Oracle\\nEngineered Systems and certain of our enterprise and data center servers, storage systems and networking products. For all other manufacturing, we generally rely on third party manufacturing partners to produce our hardware related components and\\nhardware products and we may involve our internal manufacturing operations in the final assembly, testing and quality control processes for these components and products. We distribute most of our hardware products either from our facilities or\\npartner facilities. Our manufacturing processes are based on standardization of components across product types, centralization of assembly and distribution centers and a \\x93build-to-order\\x94 methodology in which products generally are built\\nonly after customers have placed firm orders. Production of our hardware products requires that we purchase materials, supplies, product subassemblies and full assemblies from a number of vendors. For most of our hardware products, we have existing\\nalternate sources of supply or such sources are readily available. However, we do rely on sole sources for certain of our hardware products. As a result, we continue to evaluate potential risks of disruption to our supply chain operations. Refer to\\n\\x93Risk Factors\\x94 included in Item\\xa01A within this Annual Report for additional discussion of the challenges we encounter with respect to the sources and availability of supplies for our products and the related risks to our business.\\n\\n \\xa0 15 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Research and Development  We develop the substantial majority of our products internally. In addition, we have extended our product offerings and intellectual property through acquisitions of businesses and technologies. We also\\npurchase or license intellectual property rights in certain circumstances. Internal development allows us to maintain technical control over the design and development of our products. We have a number of United States and foreign patents and\\npending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology. While we believe that our patents have value, no single patent is essential to us or to any of our principal business segments. Research and development expenditures\\nwere $5.2 billion, $4.9 billion and $4.5 billion in each of fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, or 13% of total revenues in each of fiscal 2014, 2013 and 12% in fiscal 2012. Rapid technological advances in hardware and software development,\\nevolving standards in computer hardware and software technology, changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements characterize the software and cloud and hardware markets in which we compete. We plan to continue to\\ndedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development efforts to maintain and improve our current product and services offerings.  Employees  As of May\\xa031, 2014, we employed approximately 122,000 full-time employees,\\nincluding approximately 32,000 in sales and marketing, approximately 9,000 in software license updates and product support, approximately 5,000 in our cloud SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS operations, approximately 1,000 in the manufacturing of our hardware\\nsystems products, approximately 6,000 in hardware systems support, approximately 22,000 in services, approximately 36,000 in research and development and approximately 11,000 in general and administrative positions. Of these employees, approximately\\n45,000 were employed in the United States and approximately 77,000 were employed internationally. None of our employees in the United States is represented by a labor union; however, in certain foreign subsidiaries labor unions or workers\\x92\\ncouncils represent some of our employees.

The following discussion, as well as our \\x93Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\x94 discussion in Management\\x92s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 7), highlights some of\\nthese risks. The risks described below are not exhaustive and you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our securities.  Economic, political and market conditions can adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability, which in turn could\\nadversely affect our stock price.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our business is influenced by a range of factors that are beyond our control and that we have no comparative advantage in forecasting. These include: \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n general economic and business conditions;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n overall demand for enterprise software, cloud offerings, hardware systems and services; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n governmental budgetary constraints or shifts in government spending priorities;\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n general political developments; and  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n currency exchange rate fluctuations.  Macroeconomic developments like the continued slow pace of economic recovery in the United States and Europe and in parts of Asia and South America could negatively affect our business, operating results,\\nfinancial condition and outlook, which, in turn, could adversely affect our stock price. Any general weakening of, and related declining corporate confidence in, the global economy or the curtailment in government or corporate spending could cause\\ncurrent or potential customers to reduce or eliminate their information technology (IT) budgets and spending, which could cause customers to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services or cause customers not to pay us or to\\ndelay paying us for previously purchased products and services.  In addition, political unrest in places like Ukraine and its potential impact\\non global stability, terrorist attacks and the potential for other hostilities in various parts of the world, potential public health crises and natural disasters continue to contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that could\\nadversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability. These factors generally have the strongest effect on our sales of new software licenses, hardware systems products, hardware systems\\nsupport and related services and, to a lesser extent, also may affect our renewal rates for software license updates and product support and our subscription-based cloud offerings.  We may fail to achieve our financial forecasts due to inaccurate sales forecasts or other factors.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our revenues, particularly our new software licenses revenues and\\nhardware systems revenues, are difficult to forecast. As a result, our quarterly operating results can fluctuate substantially.  We use a\\n\\x93pipeline\\x94 system, a common industry practice, to forecast sales and trends in our business. Our sales personnel monitor the status of all proposals and estimate when a customer will make a purchase decision and the dollar amount of the\\nsale. These estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline. Our pipeline estimates can prove to be unreliable both in a particular quarter and over a longer period of time, in part because the \\x93conversion rate\\x94 or\\n\\x93closure rate\\x94 of the pipeline into contracts can be very difficult to estimate. A reduction in the conversion rate, or in the pipeline itself, could cause us to plan or budget incorrectly and adversely affect our business or results of\\noperations. In particular, a slowdown in IT spending or economic conditions generally can unexpectedly reduce the conversion rate in particular periods as purchasing decisions are delayed, reduced in amount or cancelled. The conversion rate can also\\nbe affected by the tendency of some of our customers to wait until the end of a fiscal period in the hope of obtaining more favorable terms, which can also impede our ability to negotiate, execute and deliver upon these contracts in a timely manner.\\nIn addition, for newly acquired companies, we have limited ability to predict how their pipelines will convert into sales or revenues for a number of quarters following the acquisition. Conversion rates post-acquisition may be quite different from\\nthe acquired companies\\x92 historical conversion rates. Differences in conversion rates can also be affected by changes in our business practices that we implement with our newly acquired companies that may affect customer behavior. \\n \\xa0 18 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n A substantial portion of our new software licenses revenue contracts and hardware systems contracts is\\ncompleted in the latter part of a quarter and a significant percentage of these are larger orders. Because a significant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the short-term, sales and revenue shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately\\nnegative impact on our profitability. The number of large new software licenses transactions and, to a lesser extent, hardware systems products transactions increases the risk of fluctuations in our quarterly results because a delay in even a small\\nnumber of these transactions could cause our quarterly sales, revenues and profitability to fall significantly short of our predictions. \\nOur cloud computing strategy, including our Oracle Cloud Software-as-a-Service, Platform-as-a-Service and Infrastructure-as-a-Service offerings, may\\nnot be successful.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We offer customers a broad portfolio of software, cloud and hardware offerings and related services to enable customers to adopt a cloud computing strategy that is right for them. These business\\nmodels continue to evolve, and we may not be able to compete effectively, generate significant revenues or maintain the profitability of our cloud offerings. Additionally, the increasing prevalence of cloud and SaaS delivery models offered by us and\\nour competitors may unfavorably impact pricing in both our on-premise enterprise software business and our cloud business, as well as overall demand for our on-premise software product and service offerings, which could reduce our revenues and\\nprofitability. If we do not successfully execute our cloud computing strategy or anticipate the cloud computing needs of our customers, our reputation as a cloud services provider could be harmed and our revenues and profitability could decline.\\n Our cloud offerings are generally purchased by customers on a subscription basis and revenues from these offerings are generally recognized\\nratably over the term of the subscriptions. The deferred revenue that results from sales of our cloud offerings may prevent any deterioration in sales activity associated with our cloud offerings from becoming immediately observable in our\\nconsolidated statement of operations. This is in contrast to revenues associated with our new software licenses arrangements whereby new software licenses revenues are generally recognized in full at the time of delivery of the related software\\nlicenses. We incur expenses associated with the infrastructures and marketing of our cloud offerings in advance of our ability to recognize the revenues associated with these offerings. To the extent customer demand for our cloud offerings\\nincreases, we could experience volatility in our reported revenues and operating results due to the differences in timing of revenue recognition between our new software licenses arrangements and cloud offering arrangements. \\nWe have also acquired a number of cloud computing companies, and the integration of these companies into our Oracle Cloud strategy may not be as efficient\\nor scalable as anticipated, which could adversely affect our ability to fully realize the benefits anticipated from these acquisitions. \\nOur success depends upon our ability to develop new products and services, integrate acquired products and services and enhance our existing\\nproducts and services.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Rapid technological advances and evolving standards in computer hardware and software development and communications infrastructure, changing and increasingly sophisticated customer needs and\\nfrequent new product introductions and enhancements characterize the industries in which we compete. If we are unable to develop new or sufficiently differentiated products and services, enhance and improve our products and support services in a\\ntimely manner or position and price our products and services to meet demand, customers may not purchase or subscribe for our software, hardware or cloud offerings or renew software or hardware support contracts. Renewals of these contracts are\\nimportant to the growth of our business. In addition, IT standards from both consortia and formal standards-setting forums as well as de facto marketplace standards are rapidly evolving. We cannot provide any assurance that the standards on which we\\nchoose to develop new products will allow us to compete effectively for business opportunities in emerging areas.  We have continued to refresh\\nand release new offerings of our software and hardware products and services, including our Database In-Memory, Oracle Cloud and Oracle Engineered Systems offerings. Our business may be adversely affected if: \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we do not continue to develop and release these or other new or enhanced products and services within the anticipated time frames;\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n there is a delay in market acceptance of a new, enhanced or acquired product line or service; \\n \\xa0 19 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n there are changes in information technology trends that we do not adequately anticipate or address with our product development efforts;\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we do not timely optimize complementary product lines and services; or \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we fail to adequately integrate, support or enhance acquired product lines or services. \\nIf our security measures for our software, hardware, services or Oracle Cloud offerings are compromised and as a result, our data, our\\ncustomers\\x92 data or our IT systems are accessed improperly, made unavailable, or improperly modified, our products and services may be perceived as vulnerable, our brand and reputation could be damaged, the IT services we provide to our\\ncustomers could be disrupted, and customers may stop using our products and services, all of which could reduce our revenue and earnings, increase our expenses and expose us to legal claims and regulatory actions.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We\\nare in the information technology business, and our products and services, including our Oracle Cloud offerings, store, retrieve, manipulate and manage our customers\\x92 information and data as well as our own. We have a reputation for secure and\\nreliable product offerings and related services and we have invested a great deal of time and resources in protecting the integrity and security of our products, services and the internal and external data that we manage. \\nNevertheless, we encounter attempts by third parties to identify and exploit product and service vulnerabilities, penetrate or bypass our security\\nmeasures, and gain unauthorized access to our software, hardware and cloud offerings, networks and systems, any of which could lead to the compromise of the confidential information or data of Oracle or our customers. Computer hackers and others may\\nbe able to develop and deploy IT related viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that could attack our products and services, exploit potential security vulnerabilities of our products and services, create system disruptions and cause\\nshutdowns or denials of service. This is also true for third party products or services incorporated into our own. Data may also be accessed or modified improperly as a result of employee or supplier error or malfeasance and third parties may\\nattempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our data, our customers\\x92 data or our IT systems. \\nAlthough this is an industry-wide problem that affects other software and hardware companies, it affects Oracle in particular because computer hackers\\ntend to focus their efforts on the most prominent IT companies, and they may focus on Oracle because of our reputation for, and marketing efforts associated with, having secure products and services. These risks will increase as we continue to grow\\nour cloud offerings and store and process increasingly large amounts of our customers\\x92 confidential information and data and host or manage parts of our customers\\x92 businesses in cloud-based IT environments, especially in customer sectors\\ninvolving particularly sensitive data such as health sciences, financial services and the government. We also have an active acquisition program and have acquired a number of companies, products, services and technologies over the years. While we\\nmake significant efforts to address any IT security issues with respect to our acquisitions, we may still inherit such risks when we integrate these acquisitions within Oracle.  If a cyber attack or other security incident described above were to allow unauthorized access to or modification of our customers\\x92 data or our own data or our IT systems or if the services we\\nprovide to our customers were disrupted, or if our products or services are perceived as having security vulnerabilities, we could suffer significant damage to our brand and reputation. Customers could lose confidence in the security and reliability\\nof our products and services, including our cloud offerings, and perceive them to be not secure. This in turn could lead to fewer customers using our products and services and result in reduced revenue and earnings. The costs we would incur to\\naddress and fix these security incidents would increase our expenses. These types of security incidents could also lead to lawsuits, regulatory investigations and claims and increased legal liability, including in some cases contractual costs\\nrelated to customer notification and fraud monitoring.  Further, as regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase and worldwide laws\\nand regulations concerning the protection of personal information expand and become more complex, these potential risks to our business will intensify. Changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of\\nsensitive data, such as healthcare data or other personally identifiable information, could greatly increase our cost of providing our products and services. \\n \\xa0 20 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n We might experience significant coding, manufacturing or configuration errors in our software,\\nhardware and cloud offerings.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Despite testing prior to their release and throughout the lifecycle of a product or service, software, hardware and cloud offerings sometimes contain coding or manufacturing errors that\\ncan impact their function, performance and security, and result in other negative consequences. The detection and correction of any errors in released software, hardware or cloud offerings can be time consuming and costly. Errors in our software,\\nhardware or cloud offerings could affect their ability to properly function or operate with other software, hardware or cloud offerings, could delay the development or release of new products or services or new versions of products or services,\\ncould result in creating security vulnerabilities in our products or services, and could adversely affect market acceptance of our products or services. This includes third party software products or services incorporated into our own. If we\\nexperience errors or delays in releasing our software, hardware or cloud offerings or new versions thereof, our sales could be affected and revenues could decline. In addition, we run Oracle\\x92s business operations as well as cloud and other\\nservices that we offer to our customers on our products and networks. Therefore, any flaws could affect our ability to conduct our business operations and the operations of our customers. Enterprise customers rely on our software and hardware\\nproducts and services to run their businesses and errors in our software, hardware or cloud offerings could expose us to product liability, performance and warranty claims as well as significant harm to our brand and reputation, which could impact\\nour future sales.  If we are unable to compete effectively, the results of operations and prospects for our business could be\\nharmed.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Many vendors develop and market databases, middleware products, application development tools, business applications, collaboration products and business intelligence products, among others, that compete with\\nour software and cloud offerings. These vendors include on-premise software companies and companies that offer SaaS or cloud computing and business process outsourcing (BPO) as competitive alternatives to buying software and hardware. Our\\ncompetitors that offer business applications and middleware products may influence a customer\\x92s purchasing decision for the underlying database in an effort to persuade potential customers not to acquire our products. We could lose customers if\\nour competitors introduce new competitive products, add new functionality, acquire competitive products, reduce prices or form strategic alliances with other companies. We may also face increasing competition from open source software initiatives in\\nwhich competitors may provide software and intellectual property for free. Existing or new competitors could gain sales opportunities or customers at our expense.  Our hardware systems business competes with, among others, (i)\\xa0systems manufacturers and resellers of systems based on our own microprocessors and operating systems and those of our competitors,\\n(ii)\\xa0microprocessor/chip manufacturers and (iii)\\xa0providers of storage products. Our hardware systems business causes us to compete with companies who historically have been partners. Some of these competitors may have more experience than\\nwe do in managing a hardware business. A large portion of our hardware products are based on our SPARC microprocessor and Oracle Solaris operating system platform, which has a smaller installed base than certain of our competitors\\x92 platforms\\nand which may make it difficult for us to win new customers that have already made significant investments in our competitors\\x92 platforms. Certain of these competitors also compete very aggressively on price. A loss in our competitive position\\ncould result in lower revenues or profitability, which could adversely impact our ability to realize the revenue and profitability forecasts for our hardware systems business.  Our international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We derive a substantial portion of our revenues\\nfrom, and have significant operations, outside of the United States. Our international operations include software and hardware systems development, manufacturing, assembly, sales, customer support, consulting and other services and shared\\nadministrative service centers.  Compliance with international and U.S.\\xa0laws and regulations that apply to our international operations\\nincreases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations include U.S.\\xa0laws and local laws which include data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, prohibitions on\\npayments to governmental officials, import and trade restrictions and export requirements. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct\\nof our business. Any such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, could delay or prevent potential \\n \\xa0 21 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nacquisitions and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results.\\nCompliance with these laws requires a significant amount of management attention and effort, which may divert management\\x92s attention from running our business operations and could harm our ability to grow our business, or may increase our\\nexpenses as we engage specialized or other additional resources to assist us with our compliance efforts. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties. We monitor our operations and investigate\\nallegations of improprieties relating to transactions and the way in which such transactions are recorded. Where circumstances warrant, we provide information and report our findings to government authorities, but no assurance can be given that\\naction will not be taken by such authorities.  We are also subject to a variety of other risks and challenges in managing an organization\\noperating in various countries, including those related to:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n general economic conditions in each country or region; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n fluctuations in currency exchange rates and related impacts to our operating results; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n difficulties in transferring funds from or converting currencies in certain countries such as Venezuela that have led to a devaluation of our net\\nassets, in particular our cash assets, in that country\\x92s currency;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n regulatory changes, including government austerity measures in certain countries that we may not be able to sufficiently plan for or avoid that may\\nunexpectedly impair bank deposits or other cash assets that we hold in these countries or that impose additional taxes that we may be required to pay in these countries; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n political unrest, terrorism and the potential for other hostilities, including those in Ukraine; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n natural disasters;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n overlapping tax regimes;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n our ability to repatriate funds held by our foreign subsidiaries to the United States at favorable tax rates; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n public health risks, particularly in areas in which we have significant operations; and \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.  The variety of risks and challenges listed above could also disrupt or otherwise negatively impact the supply chain operations for our hardware systems products segment and the sales of our products and\\nservices in affected countries or regions.  As the majority shareholder of Oracle Financial Services Software Limited (OFSS), a publicly traded\\nIndian software company focused on the banking industry, we are faced with several additional risks, including being subject to local securities regulations and being unable to exert full control that we would otherwise have if OFSS were a wholly\\nowned subsidiary.  Acquisitions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the\\ntime of a transaction.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of companies, products, services and technologies. An active acquisition program is an important element of our overall\\ncorporate strategy and we expect to continue to make acquisitions in the future. Risks we may face in connection with our acquisition program include:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n our ongoing business may be disrupted and our management\\x92s attention may be diverted by acquisition, transition or integration activities;\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n an acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected, we may not integrate an acquired company or technology as successfully as we\\nexpected or we may overpay for, or otherwise not realize the expected return on, our investments, which could adversely affect our business or operating results and potentially cause impairment to assets that we recorded as a part of an acquisition\\nincluding intangible assets and goodwill;

 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may not realize the anticipated increase in our revenues from an acquisition for a number of reasons, including if a larger than predicted number of\\ncustomers decline to renew software or hardware support contracts or cloud-based subscription contracts, if we are unable to sell the acquired products or service offerings to our customer base or if contract models of an acquired company do not\\nallow us to recognize revenues on a timely basis;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technologies, products, services and their related supply chain operations with our existing lines of\\nbusiness and supply chain infrastructure and maintaining uniform standards, architecture, controls, procedures and policies;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may have multiple product lines or services offerings as a result of our acquisitions that are offered, priced and supported differently, which\\ncould cause customer confusion and delays;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may have higher than anticipated costs in continuing support and development of acquired products or services, in general and administrative\\nfunctions that support new business models, or in compliance with associated regulations that are more complicated than we had anticipated;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may be unable to obtain timely approvals from, or may otherwise have certain limitations, restrictions, penalties or other sanctions imposed on us\\nby, worker councils or similar bodies under applicable employment laws as a result of an acquisition, which could adversely affect our integration plans in certain jurisdictions and potentially increase our integration and restructuring expenses;\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may be unable to obtain required approvals from governmental authorities under competition and antitrust laws on a timely basis, if at all, which\\ncould, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of an acquisition or have other adverse effects on our current business and operations;\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n our use of cash to pay for acquisitions may limit other potential uses of our cash, including stock repurchases, dividend payments and retirement of\\noutstanding indebtedness;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition and we\\nmay have to delay or not proceed with a substantial acquisition if we cannot obtain the necessary funding to complete the acquisition in a timely manner or on favorable terms; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n to the extent that we issue a significant amount of equity securities in connection with future acquisitions, existing stockholders may be diluted and\\nearnings per share may decrease; and  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may experience additional or unexpected changes in how we are required to account for our acquisitions pursuant to U.S. generally accepted\\naccounting principles, including arrangements that we assume from an acquisition. \\n \\xa0 23 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\\noperations, financial condition or cash flows, particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or several concurrent acquisitions.  We\\nmay experience foreign currency gains and losses.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We conduct a significant number of transactions and hold cash in currencies other than the U.S.\\xa0Dollar. Changes in the value of major foreign currencies,\\nparticularly the Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound relative to the U.S.\\xa0Dollar can significantly affect our assets, revenues and operating results. Generally, our revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the dollar\\nstrengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the dollar weakens. Generally, our assets that we report are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies as a significant portion of our\\nconsolidated cash and bank deposits, among other assets, are held in foreign currencies.  During fiscal 2014 and 2013, we incurred foreign\\ncurrency losses associated with our Venezuelan subsidiary due to it being designated as operating in a highly inflationary economy and due to the subsequent devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar relative to the U.S. Dollar. We may incur similar\\nforeign currency losses for countries that are dealing with similar risks of high inflation, such as in certain Latin American and other emerging market countries where we do business.  In addition, we incur foreign currency transaction gains and losses, primarily related to sublicense fees and other intercompany agreements among us and our subsidiaries that we expect to cash settle in\\nthe near term, which are charged against earnings in the period incurred. We have a program which primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with these foreign currency exposures that we may suspend from\\ntime to time. As a part of this program, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate\\nthe risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transaction gains or losses. A large portion of our consolidated operations are international, and we expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign\\ncurrency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts. For example, we will experience foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances if it is not possible or cost effective to hedge our foreign currency\\nexposures or should we suspend our foreign currency forward contract program. Our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency exposures that we enter into, the\\ncurrency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, whether we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors.\\xa0All of these factors could materially impact our\\nresults of operations, financial position and cash flows.  Our periodic workforce restructurings, including reorganizations of our sales\\nforce, can be disruptive.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We have in the past restructured or made other adjustments to our workforce, including our direct sales force on which we rely heavily, in response to management changes, product changes,\\nperformance issues, acquisitions and other internal and external considerations. In the past, these types of sales force restructurings have resulted in increased restructuring costs, increased sales and marketing costs and temporary reduced\\nproductivity while the sales teams adjusted to their new roles and responsibilities. In addition, we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth or cost savings benefits of these restructurings, or do so within the expected timeframe. These\\neffects could recur in connection with future acquisitions and other restructurings and our revenues and other results of operations could be negatively affected.  Our hardware systems revenues and profitability could decline if we do not manage the risks associated with our hardware systems business.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our hardware systems\\nbusiness may adversely affect our overall profitability if we do not effectively manage the associated risks. We may not achieve our estimated revenue, profit or other financial projections with respect to our hardware systems business in a timely\\nmanner or at all due to a number of factors, including:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n as we develop and introduce new versions or next generations of our hardware systems products, customers may defer or delay purchases of existing\\nhardware systems products and wait for these new releases, all of which could adversely affect our hardware systems revenues in the short term; \\n \\xa0 24 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n our hardware systems business has higher expenses as a percentage of revenues, and thus has been less profitable, than our software and cloud business;\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n our focus on our more profitable Oracle Engineered Systems, such as our Oracle Exadata Database Machine, Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud and Oracle\\nSuperCluster products, which are in the relatively early stages of adoption by our customers, and our de-emphasis of our lower profit margin commodity hardware systems products that historically constituted a larger portion of our hardware systems\\nrevenues;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we face a greater risk of potential write-downs and impairments of inventory, higher warranty expenses than in our software and cloud and services\\nbusinesses, higher amortization from intangible assets, and potential impairment of intangible assets and goodwill associated with our hardware systems business. Any of these items could result in material charges and adversely affect our operating\\nresults;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may not be able to increase sales of hardware systems support contracts or such increase may take longer than we anticipate, which could result in\\nlower revenues and profitability, or slower than expected growth of such revenues and profitability; and  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we may acquire hardware companies that are strategically important to us but operate in hardware businesses with historically lower operating margins\\nthan our own; that leverage different platforms or competing technologies that we may encounter difficulties in integrating; or that utilize unique manufacturing processes that affect our ability to scale these acquired products within our own\\nmanufacturing operations.  Our hardware systems offerings are complex products, and if we cannot successfully manage\\nthis complexity, the results of our hardware systems business will suffer.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Designing, developing, manufacturing and introducing new hardware systems products are complicated processes. The development process for our\\nhardware systems products is uncertain and requires a high level of innovation. After the development phase, we must be able to forecast customer demand and manufacture new hardware systems products in sufficient volumes to meet this demand and do\\nso in a cost effective manner. Our \\x93build-to-order\\x94 manufacturing model, in which our hardware systems products generally are not built until after customers place orders, may from time to time experience delays in delivering our hardware\\nsystems products to customers in a timely manner. These delays could cause our customers to purchase hardware products and services from our competitors. We must also manage new hardware product introductions and transitions to minimize the impact\\nof customer delayed purchases of existing hardware systems products in anticipation of new hardware systems product releases. It is also possible that we could experience design or manufacturing flaws which could delay or prevent the production of\\nthe components for which we have previously committed to pay or need to fulfill orders from customers and could also prevent the production of our hardware products or cause our hardware products to be returned, recalled or rejected resulting in\\nlost revenues, increases in warranty costs or costs related to remediation efforts, damage to our reputation, penalties and litigation.  We\\ndepend on suppliers to design, develop, manufacture and deliver on a timely basis the necessary components for our hardware products, and there are some components that can only be purchased from a single vendor due to price, quality, technology,\\navailability or other business constraints. As a result, our supply chain operations could be disrupted or negatively impacted by natural disasters, political unrest or other factors affecting the countries or regions where these single source\\ncomponent vendors are located. We may be unable to purchase these items from the respective single vendors on acceptable terms or may experience significant delays or quality issues in the delivery of necessary parts or components from a particular\\nvendor. If we had to find a new supplier for these parts and components, hardware systems product shipments could be delayed, which would adversely affect our hardware systems revenues. We could also experience fluctuations in component prices\\nwhich, if unanticipated, could negatively impact our hardware systems business cost structure. These factors may make it difficult for us to plan and procure appropriate component inventory levels in a timely fashion to meet customer demand for our\\nhardware products. Therefore we may experience component inventory shortages which may result in production delays or customers choosing to purchase fewer hardware products from us or systems products from our competitors. We negotiate supply\\ncommitments with vendors early in the manufacturing process to ensure we have sufficient components for our hardware products to meet anticipated \\n \\xa0 25 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\ncustomer demand. We must also manage our levels of older component inventories used in our hardware products to minimize inventory write-offs or write-downs. If we have excess inventory, it may\\nbe necessary to write-down the inventory, which would adversely affect our operating results. If one or more of the risks described above occurs, our hardware systems business and related operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\\n We are susceptible to third party manufacturing and logistics delays, which could result in the loss of sales and\\ncustomers.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We outsource the manufacturing, assembly and delivery of certain of our hardware products to a variety of companies, many of which are located outside the United States. Our reliance on these third parties\\nreduces our control over the manufacturing and delivery process, exposing us to risks, including reduced control over quality assurance, product costs, product supply and delivery delays as well as the political and economic uncertainties and\\nnatural disasters of the international locations where certain of these third party manufacturers have facilities and operations. Any manufacturing disruption or logistics delays by these third parties could impair our ability to fulfill orders for\\nthese hardware systems products for extended periods of time. If we are unable to manage our relationships with these third parties effectively, or if these third parties experience delays, disruptions, capacity constraints, regulatory issues or\\nquality control problems in their operations, or fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery, our ability to ship and deliver certain of our hardware systems products to our customers could be impaired and our hardware systems business\\ncould be harmed.  We have simplified our supply chain processes by reducing the number of third party manufacturing partners and the number of\\nlocations where these third party manufacturers build our hardware systems products. We therefore have become more dependent on a fewer number of these manufacturing partners and locations. If these partners experience production problems or delays\\nor cannot meet our demand for products, we may not be able to find alternate manufacturing sources in a timely or cost effective manner, if at all. If we are required to change third party manufacturers, our ability to meet our scheduled hardware\\nsystems products deliveries to our customers could be adversely affected, which could cause the loss of sales and existing or potential customers, delayed revenue recognition or an increase in our hardware systems products expenses, all of which\\ncould adversely affect the margins of our hardware business.  These challenges and risks also exist when we acquire companies with hardware\\nproducts and related supply chain operations. In some cases, we may be dependent, at least initially, on these acquired companies\\x92 supply chain operations that we are less familiar with and thus we may be slower to adjust or react to these\\nchallenges and risks.  Our mixed direct and indirect sales model for our hardware systems products may not succeed and could result in\\nlower hardware revenues or profits. Disruptions to our software indirect sales channel could affect our future operating results.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Although we sell our hardware systems products through indirect channels, including\\nindependent distributors and value added resellers, we have enhanced our direct sales coverage for our hardware products and intend that our direct sales force will sell a larger portion of our hardware products in the future than they do now. These\\ndirect sales efforts, however, may not be successful. Our relationships with some of our channel partners may deteriorate because we have reduced our reliance on some of these partners for sales of our hardware products and have modified our\\napproach and timing to the manufacturing of our products, which could result in reduced demand from the channel partners or certain customer segments serviced by these channel partners. Some hardware revenues from channel partners may not be\\nreplaced by revenues generated from our own sales personnel or may not be replaced as quickly as we expect. In addition, our sales personnel may not be able to achieve our sales forecasts for our hardware business. If we experience any of these\\nrisks, our hardware revenues and profits may decline.  Our software indirect channel network is comprised primarily of resellers, system\\nintegrators/implementers, consultants, education providers, internet service providers, network integrators and independent software vendors. Our relationships with these channel participants are important elements of our software marketing and\\nsales efforts. Our financial results could be adversely affected if our contracts with channel participants were terminated, if our relationships with channel participants were to deteriorate, if any of our competitors enter into strategic\\nrelationships with or acquire a significant channel participant, if the financial condition or operations of our channel participants were to weaken or if the level of demand for our channel participants\\x92 products and\\n\\n \\xa0 26 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nservices were to decrease. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining, expanding or developing our relationships with channel participants. If we are not successful, we\\nmay lose sales opportunities, customers and revenues.  We may not be able to protect our intellectual property\\nrights.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We rely on copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts, these\\nprotections may be limited. Unauthorized third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer portions of our products or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property. Any patents owned by us may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. Any of\\nour pending or future patent applications, whether or not being currently challenged, may not be issued with the scope of the claims we seek, if at all. In addition, the laws of some countries do not provide the same level of protection of our\\nintellectual property rights as do the laws and courts of the United States. If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use, or other misappropriation, we may not remain competitive. \\nThird parties have claimed and, in the future, may claim infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights and/or breach of license agreement\\nprovisions.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We periodically receive notices from, or have lawsuits filed against us by, others claiming infringement or other misuse of their intellectual property rights and/or breach of our agreements with them.\\nThese third parties include entities that do not have the capabilities to design, manufacture, or distribute products or services or that acquire intellectual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual\\nproperty through asserting claims of infringement and misuse. We expect the number of such claims will increase as:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n we continue to acquire companies and expand into new businesses; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the use and support of third party code (including open source code) becomes more prevalent in the industry;\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the volume of issued patents continues to increase; and \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the proliferation of non-practicing entities asserting intellectual property infringement claims increases. \\nResponding to any such claim, regardless of its validity, could:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n be time consuming, costly and result in litigation;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n divert management\\x92s time and attention from developing our business; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable;\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n require us to stop selling or to redesign certain of our products; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n require us to release source code to third parties, possibly under open source license terms; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n require us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers;\\xa0or; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. \\nWe may lose key employees or may be unable to hire enough qualified employees.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We rely on the continued service of\\nour senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer and founder, members of our executive team and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees. In the technology industry, there is substantial and continuous competition\\nfor highly skilled business, product development, technical and other personnel. In addition, acquisitions could cause us to lose key personnel of the acquired companies or at Oracle. We may also experience increased compensation costs that are not\\noffset by either improved productivity or higher sales. We may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel. With rare exceptions, we do not have long-term employment or non-competition agreements\\nwith our employees. Members of our senior management team have left Oracle over the years for a variety of reasons, and we cannot assure you that there will not be additional departures, which may be disruptive to our operations. \\n \\xa0 27 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n We continually focus on improving our cost structure by hiring personnel in countries where advanced\\ntechnical expertise and other expertise are available at lower costs. When we make adjustments to our workforce, we may incur expenses associated with workforce reductions that delay the benefit of a more efficient workforce structure. We may also\\nexperience increased competition for employees in these countries as the trend toward globalization continues, which may affect our employee retention efforts and increase our expenses in an effort to offer a competitive compensation program. Our\\ncompensation program includes stock options, which are an important tool in attracting and retaining employees in our industry. If our stock price performs poorly, it may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract employees. In addition,\\nbecause we expense all stock-based compensation, we may in the future change our stock-based and other compensation practices. Some of the changes we consider from time to time include a reduction in the number of employees granted stock options, a\\nreduction in the number of stock options granted per employee and a change to alternative forms of stock-based compensation, all of which may have an impact on our ability to retain employees and also impact the amount of stock-based compensation\\nexpense that we record. Any changes in our compensation practices or changes made by competitors could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel.  Our sales to government clients subject us to business volatility and risks, including government budgeting cycles and appropriations, early termination, audits, investigations, sanctions and\\npenalties.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We derive revenues from contracts with the U.S. government, state and local governments, and foreign governments and their respective agencies, which may terminate most of these contracts at any time,\\nwithout cause. There is increased pressure for governments and their agencies, both domestically and internationally, to reduce spending. Further, our U.S. federal government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations being made by the\\nU.S. Congress to fund the expenditures under these contracts. Similarly, our contracts at the state and local levels in the U.S. and our contracts with foreign governments and their agencies are generally subject to government funding\\nauthorizations. Additionally, government contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations which could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refund of a portion of\\nfees received, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business.  We may\\nneed to change our pricing models to compete successfully.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The intense competition we face in the sales of our products and services and general economic and business conditions can put pressure on us to change our\\nprices. If our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable, we may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully. Any such\\nchanges may reduce margins and could adversely affect operating results. Additionally, the increasing prevalence of cloud and SaaS delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact pricing in both our on-premise enterprise\\nsoftware business and our cloud business, as well as overall demand for our on-premise software product and service offerings, which could reduce our revenues and profitability. Our software license updates and product support fees and hardware\\nsystems support fees are generally priced as a percentage of our net new software licenses fees and net new hardware systems products fees, respectively. Our competitors may offer lower pricing on their support offerings, which could put pressure on\\nus to further discount our product or support pricing.  Any broad-based change to our prices and pricing policies could cause our revenues to\\ndecline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies. Some of our competitors may bundle products for promotional purposes or as a long-term pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and\\nproduct implementations. These practices could, over time, significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for certain of our products. If we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of our products or changes in\\ncustomer demand, our revenues could decrease. The increase in open source software distribution may also cause us to change our pricing models. \\nWe may not receive significant revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years, if at\\nall.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Developing software, cloud and hardware offerings is expensive and the investment in the development of these offerings often involves a long return on investment cycle. We have made and expect to continue to make\\nsignificant investments in research and development and related product and service opportunities both through internal investments and the acquisition of intellectual property from companies that we have acquired. Accelerated product and service\\nintroductions and short software and hardware life cycles \\n \\xa0 28 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nrequire high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by revenue increases. We believe that we must continue to dedicate\\na significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. However, we do not expect to receive significant revenues from these investments for several years, if at all. \\nBusiness disruptions could adversely affect our operating results.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0A significant portion of our research and\\ndevelopment activities and certain other critical business operations are concentrated in a few geographic areas. We are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems could cause delays in completing sales and providing\\nservices, including some of our cloud offerings. A major earthquake, fire or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal\\nbusiness operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected.  Adverse litigation\\nresults could affect our business.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We are subject to various legal proceedings. Litigation can be lengthy, expensive and disruptive to our operations, and can divert our management\\x92s attention away from the\\nrunning of our business. The results of our litigation also cannot be predicted with certainty. An adverse decision could result in monetary damages or injunctive relief that could affect our business, operating results or financial condition.\\nAdditional information regarding certain of the lawsuits we are involved in is discussed under Note\\xa018 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.  \\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as\\nwell as non-income based taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are regularly under audit by tax\\nauthorities and those authorities often do not agree with positions taken by us on our tax returns.  Changes in tax laws or tax rulings may\\nhave a significantly adverse impact on our effective tax rate. For example, the United States, many countries in the European Union, and other countries where we do business, are actively considering changes in relevant tax, accounting and other\\nlaws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, which, if enacted, could have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. Further, in the ordinary course of a global business,\\nthere are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our intercompany transfer pricing has been and is currently being reviewed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and by foreign tax\\njurisdictions and will likely be subject to additional audits in the future. We have negotiated certain unilateral Advance Pricing Agreements with the IRS and certain selected bilateral Advance Pricing Agreements that cover many of our intercompany\\ntransfer pricing issues and preclude the relevant tax authorities from making a transfer pricing adjustment within the scope of these agreements. However, these agreements do not cover substantial elements of our transfer pricing. In addition, our\\nprovision for income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions which we consider to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States that have lower statutory tax rates and earnings being higher\\nthan anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates.  We are also subject to non-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales,\\nuse, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities with respect to these non-income based taxes and may have exposure to\\nadditional non-income based tax liabilities. Our acquisition activities have increased our non-income based tax exposures, particularly with our entry into the hardware systems business, which increased the volume and complexity of laws and\\nregulations that we are subject to and with which we must comply. Although we believe that our income and non-income based tax estimates are\\nreasonable, there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Charges to earnings resulting from acquisitions may adversely affect our operating results.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Under business combination accounting standards pursuant to ASC 805,\\nBusiness Combinations, we recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interests in acquired companies generally at their \\n \\xa0 29 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nacquisition date fair values and, in each case, separately from goodwill. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess amount of consideration transferred, which is also\\ngenerally measured at fair value, and the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently\\nuncertain. After we complete an acquisition, the following factors could result in material charges and adversely affect our operating results and may adversely affect our cash flows: \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n costs incurred to combine the operations of companies we acquire, such as transitional employee expenses and employee retention, redeployment or\\nrelocation expenses;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n impairment of goodwill or intangible assets, in particular within our hardware systems products or consulting reporting units, for which the amounts of\\ngoodwill and intangible assets that we have recorded increased in recent years and may continue to increase in the future, and for which we have experienced revenues and/or margin declines as compared to prior years; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n amortization of intangible assets acquired;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n a reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets acquired; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n identification of or changes to assumed contingent liabilities, both income tax and non-income tax related, after our final determination of the\\namounts for these contingencies or the conclusion of the measurement period (generally up to one year from the acquisition date), whichever comes first; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n charges to our operating results to maintain certain duplicative pre-merger activities for an extended period of time or to maintain these activities\\nfor a period of time that is longer than we had anticipated, charges to eliminate certain duplicative pre-merger activities, and charges to restructure our operations or to reduce our cost structure; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n charges to our operating results due to expenses incurred to effect the acquisition; and \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n charges to our operating results due to the expensing of certain stock awards assumed in an acquisition. \\nSubstantially all of these costs will be accounted for as expenses that will decrease our net income and earnings per share for the periods in which those\\ncosts are incurred. Charges to our operating results in any given period could differ substantially from other periods based on the timing and size of our future acquisitions and the extent of integration activities. A more detailed discussion of\\nour accounting for business combinations and other items is presented in the \\x93Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\x94 section of Management\\x92s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 7).\\n There are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0As of May\\xa031, 2014, we had\\nan aggregate of $24.2 billion of outstanding indebtedness that will mature between the remainder of calendar 2014 and calendar 2040 and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our\\nindebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations, generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt and the other factors discussed in this section. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these\\nrisks successfully.  We may also need to refinance a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to\\nrefinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon\\nrefinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. Should we incur future increases in interest expense, our ability to utilize certain of our foreign tax credits to reduce our U.S. federal income tax\\ncould be limited, which could unfavorably affect our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. In addition, changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity\\nsecurities and increase the interest amounts we pay on outstanding or future debt. These risks could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  Environmental and other related laws and regulations subject us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Some of our cloud and\\nhardware systems operations are subject to state, federal and international laws governing protection of the environment, proper handling and disposal of materials \\n \\xa0 30 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nused for these offerings, human health and safety, and regulating the use of certain chemical substances. We endeavor to comply with these environmental and other laws, yet compliance with such\\nlaws could increase our product design, development, procurement, manufacturing, delivery and administration costs, limit our ability to manage excess and obsolete non-compliant inventory, change our sales activities, or otherwise impact future\\nfinancial results of our cloud and hardware systems businesses. Any violation of these laws can subject us to significant liability, including fines, penalties and possible prohibition of sales of our products and services into one or more states or\\ncountries and result in a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our cloud and hardware systems businesses. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted disclosure requirements for companies that\\nuse certain \\x93conflict minerals\\x94 (commonly referred to as tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold) in their products. Our supply chain is multi-tiered, global and highly complex. As a provider of hardware systems end products, we are several steps\\nremoved from the mining and smelting or refining of any \\x93conflict minerals\\x94 in our supply chain. Accordingly, our ability to determine with certainty the origin and chain of custody of \\x93conflict minerals\\x94 is limited. Our\\nrelationships with customers and suppliers could suffer if we are unable to describe our products as \\x93conflict-free.\\x94 We may also face increased costs in complying with conflict mineral disclosure requirements. A significant portion of our\\nhardware systems revenues come from international sales. Environmental legislation within the European Union (EU), including the EU Directive on Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE\\nDirective), as well as China\\x92s regulation on Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products may increase our cost of doing business internationally and impact our hardware systems revenues from EU\\ncountries and China as we endeavor to comply with and implement these requirements. In addition, similar environmental legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions, the cumulative impact of which could be significant. \\nOur stock price could become more volatile and your investment could lose value.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0All of the factors discussed in this\\nsection could affect our stock price. The timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products, product enhancements or technological advances by our competitors or us and any announcements by us of acquisitions, major transactions,\\nor management changes could also affect our stock price. Changes in the amounts and frequency of share repurchases or dividends could adversely affect our stock price. Our stock price is subject to speculation in the press and the analyst community,\\nchanges in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts, changes in investors\\x92 or analysts\\x92 valuation measures for our stock, our credit ratings and market trends unrelated to our performance. A significant drop in our stock\\nprice could also expose us to the risk of securities class actions lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and divert management\\x92s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business. \\nItem\\xa01B. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Unresolved Staff Comments  None.

In June 2014, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per share of our outstanding common\\nstock payable on July\\xa030, 2014 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July\\xa09, 2014. We currently expect to continue paying comparable cash dividends on a quarterly basis; however, future declarations of dividends and the\\nestablishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.  For equity compensation\\nplan information, please refer to Item\\xa012 in Part III of this Annual Report.  Stock Repurchase Programs \\nOur Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On June\\xa020, 2013, we announced that our Board of\\nDirectors approved an expansion of our stock repurchase program by an additional $12.0\\xa0billion. Approximately $4.3 billion remained available for stock repurchases as of May\\xa031, 2014 pursuant to our stock repurchase program. \\nOur stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working\\ncapital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time\\nthrough open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.

This overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and\\njudgments incorporated in our reported financial results. We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition.  Business Overview  We are the world\\x92s largest provider of enterprise software and a\\nleading provider of computer hardware products and services that are engineered to work together in the cloud and in the data center. Our offerings include Oracle database and middleware software, application software, cloud infrastructure, hardware\\nsystems\\x97including computer server, storage and networking products\\x97and related services. We develop and maintain our products and services to be enterprise-grade, reliable, secure and interoperable while offering customers a choice in\\ndeployment models that best meet their information technology (IT) needs. Our customers can subscribe to use many Oracle software and hardware products through our Oracle Cloud offerings, or purchase our software and hardware products and related\\nservices to build their own internal clouds or on-premise IT environments.  Cloud computing IT environments, including those offered through\\nour Oracle Cloud Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure-as-a-Service offerings, are designed to be attractive and cost-effective options for our customers as we integrate the software and hardware on the\\ncustomers\\x92 behalf in IT environments that we deploy, support and manage on the customers\\x92 behalf. We are a leader in the core technologies of cloud computing, including database and middleware software as well as web-based applications,\\nvirtualization, clustering, large-scale systems management and related infrastructure. Our products and services are the building blocks of our own cloud services, our partners\\x92 cloud services and our customers\\x92 cloud IT environments. An\\nimportant element of our corporate strategy is to deliver reliable, secure and scalable products and services that are built upon industry standards and are engineered to work both together or independently, regardless of the deployment model\\nselected.  We believe that our investments in, and continued innovation with respect to, our software and cloud, hardware, and services\\nbusinesses are the foundation of our long-term strategic plans. In fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012 we invested $5.2 billion, $4.9 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively, in research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of products and\\nservices and to develop new products and services. We have expanded our enterprise-grade cloud computing offerings through our continued investments in research and development and through targeted acquisitions in order to broaden our Oracle Cloud\\nofferings. For example, our Oracle Cloud Software-as-a-Service offerings, including our sales, marketing, customer service, financials, project management, human capital and talent management cloud solutions, among others, enable us to provide IT\\nfunctionality that customers can use to manage critical business functions in a rapidly deployable delivery model with lower upfront customer investment. Certain of our enterprise-grade cloud computing offerings include infrastructure based upon our\\nOracle Engineered Systems, including our Oracle Exadata Database Machine, Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud and Oracle SuperCluster products, among others. We designed our Oracle Engineered Systems to combine certain of our hardware and software\\nofferings to increase computing performance relative to our competitors\\x92 products, creating cost efficiencies, time savings and operational cost advantages for our customers. Our Oracle Engineered Systems provide the core infrastructure for our\\nown on-premise IT data centers and those of our customers, and for cloud IT environments, including our own Oracle Cloud services, our partners\\x92 cloud services and our customers\\x92 cloud environments. We also continue to demonstrate our\\ncommitment to customer choice through ongoing enhancements to our Oracle E-Business Suite, Siebel, PeopleSoft and JD Edwards application software products and services, amongst others.  We believe that an active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy as it enhances the products and services that we can offer to customers, expands our customer base,\\nprovides greater scale to accelerate innovation, grows our revenues and earnings and increases stockholder value. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of companies, products, services and technologies that add\\nto, are complementary to, or have otherwise enhanced our existing offerings. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies to further our corporate strategy. \\n \\xa0 35 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n We are organized into three businesses\\x97software and cloud, hardware systems and services\\x97which are\\nfurther divided into certain operating segments. Each of our businesses and operating segments has unique characteristics and faces different opportunities and challenges. Although we report our actual results in U.S. Dollars, we conduct a\\nsignificant number of transactions in currencies other than U.S. Dollars. Therefore, we present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency rate\\nfluctuations. Our cloud infrastructure-as-a-service segment was established during our fiscal quarter ended May\\xa031, 2014. Our fiscal 2014 results, and historical results for fiscal 2013 and 2012, reflect this new segment structure and will\\ncontinue prospectively in our future filings. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for additional information related to our operating segments. An overview of our three businesses and\\nrelated operating segments follows.  Software and Cloud Business  Our software and cloud business, which represented 76%, 75% and 72% of our total revenues in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, is comprised of three operating segments: (1)\\xa0new software\\nlicenses and cloud software subscriptions, (2)\\xa0cloud infrastructure-as-a-service and (3)\\xa0software license updates and product support. On a constant currency basis, we expect that our software and cloud business\\x92 total revenues\\ngenerally will continue to increase due to continued demand for our software products and subscription offerings, our software license updates and product support offerings, including the high percentage of customers that renew their software\\nlicense updates and product support contracts, and our acquisitions, which should allow us to grow our profits and continue to make investments in research and development.  New Software Licenses and Cloud Software Subscriptions:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We license our database and middleware, as well as our application software, and provide access to a broad\\nrange of our software through Oracle Cloud Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and Oracle Cloud Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offerings (SaaS and PaaS collectively are referred to as cloud software subscriptions). Our software offerings are substantially\\nbuilt on a standards-based, integrated architecture that is designed to help customers reduce the cost and complexity of their IT infrastructure. Our software offerings are substantially designed to operate on both single server and clustered server\\nconfigurations for cloud or on-premise IT environments, and to support a choice of operating systems including Oracle Solaris, Oracle Linux, Microsoft Windows and third party UNIX products, among others. Our customers include businesses of many\\nsizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers. We market and sell our software products and services to these customers with a sales force positioned to offer the combinations that best fit their needs. We enable customers to\\nevolve and transform to substantially any IT environment at whatever pace is most appropriate for them.  The growth in our new software\\nlicenses and our SaaS and PaaS revenues that we report is affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, the competitive position of our software offerings, our acquisitions and foreign\\ncurrency fluctuations. The substantial majority of our new software licenses transactions are characterized by long sales cycles and the timing of a few large software license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly new software licenses\\nrevenues. New software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues represented 28% of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2014 and 2013 and 27% in fiscal 2012. Our cloud software subscriptions contracts, which consist of SaaS and PaaS\\narrangements, are generally one to three years in duration and we strive to renew these contracts when they are eligible for renewal. Our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions segment\\x92s margin has historically trended upward\\nover the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our new software licenses revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this segment are predominantly fixed\\nin the short-term. However, our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions segment\\x92s margin has been and will continue to be affected by the fair value adjustments relating to the cloud software subscriptions obligations that we\\nassumed in our business combinations (described further below) and by the amortization of intangible assets associated with companies and technologies that we have acquired.  For certain of our acquired businesses, we recorded adjustments to reduce the cloud SaaS and PaaS obligations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. As a result, as required by business\\ncombination accounting rules, we did not recognize cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues related to acquired contracts that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $17 million, $45 million\\n\\n \\xa0 36 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nand $22 million in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. To the extent underlying cloud SaaS and PaaS contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition, we will recognize the revenues\\nfor the full values of these contracts over their respective contractual periods.  Cloud\\nInfrastructure-as-a-Service:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our cloud infrastructure-as-a-service offerings (IaaS), which represented 1% of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2014 and 2013 and 2% in fiscal 2012, provide deployment and management\\nofferings for our software and hardware and related IT infrastructure including virtual machine instances that are subscription-based and designed for computing and reliable and secure object storage; Oracle Engineered Systems hardware and related\\nsupport that are deployed in our customers\\x92 data centers for a monthly fee; and comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services arrangements for customer IT infrastructure for a stated term that is hosted at our data\\ncenter facilities, select partner data centers or physically on-premise at customer facilities.  Software License Updates and Product\\nSupport:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Customers that purchase software license updates and product support are granted rights to unspecified product upgrades and maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period, as\\nwell as technical support assistance. Our software license updates and product support contracts are generally one year in duration and substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually.\\nThe growth of software license updates and product support revenues is primarily influenced by three factors: (1)\\xa0the percentage of our software support contract customer base that renews its software support contracts, (2)\\xa0the amount of\\nnew software support contracts sold in connection with the sale of new software licenses and (3)\\xa0the amount of software support contracts assumed from companies we have acquired.  Software license updates and product support revenues, which represented 47%, 46% and 43% of our total revenues in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, is our highest margin business unit. Our\\nsoftware support margins during fiscal 2014 were 89% and accounted for 77% of our total margins over the same period. Our software license updates and product support margins have been affected by fair value adjustments relating to software support\\nobligations assumed in business combinations (described further below) and by amortization of intangible assets. However, over the longer term, we believe that software license updates and product support revenues and margins will grow for the\\nfollowing reasons:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software support contracts when eligible for renewal;\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n substantially all of our customers purchase software license updates and product support contracts when they buy new software licenses, resulting in a\\nfurther increase in our software support contract base. Even if new software licenses revenues growth was flat, software license updates and product support revenues would continue to grow in comparison to the corresponding prior year periods\\nassuming contract renewal and cancellation rates and foreign currency rates remained relatively constant since substantially all new software licenses transactions result in the sale of software license updates and product support contracts, which\\nadd to our software support contract base; and  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n our acquisitions have increased our software support contract base, as well as the portfolio of products available to be licensed and supported.\\n We recorded adjustments to reduce software support obligations assumed in business combinations to their estimated fair\\nvalues at the acquisition dates. As a result, as required by business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to software support contracts that would have been otherwise\\nrecorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $3\\xa0million, $14 million and $48 million in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. To the extent underlying software support contracts are renewed with us following\\nan acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of the software support contracts over the respective support periods, the majority of which are one year.  Hardware Systems Business   Our hardware systems business is comprised of two\\noperating segments: (1)\\xa0hardware systems products and (2)\\xa0hardware systems support. Our hardware business represented 14% of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2014 and 2013 and 17% in fiscal 2012. We expect our hardware business to have\\nlower operating margins as a \\n \\xa0 37 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\npercentage of revenues than our software and cloud business due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services, including direct\\nmaterials and labor costs. We expect to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and services and to develop new hardware products and services.  Hardware Systems Products:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We provide a broad selection of hardware systems and related services including servers, storage, networking, virtualization software,\\noperating systems, and management software to support diverse IT environments, including cloud computing environments. We engineer our hardware systems with virtualization and management capabilities to enable the rapid deployment and efficient\\nmanagement of cloud and on-premise IT infrastructures. Our hardware products support many of the world\\x92s largest cloud infrastructures, including the Oracle Cloud.  Our hardware products and services are designed to work in customer environments that may include other Oracle or non-Oracle hardware or software components. This flexible and open approach provides\\nOracle\\x92s customers with a broad range of choices in deploying hardware systems, which we believe is a priority for our customers. Our hardware products and services also help to meet customers\\x92 demands to manage growing amounts of data and\\nbusiness requirements to meet increasing compliance and regulatory demands and to reduce energy, space and operational costs. We have also engineered our hardware systems products to create performance and operational cost advantages for customers\\nwhen our hardware and software products are combined as Oracle Engineered Systems.  We offer a wide range of server systems using our SPARC\\nmicroprocessor. Our SPARC servers run the Oracle Solaris operating system and are designed to be differentiated by their reliability, security, and scalability. Our mid-size and large servers are designed to offer greater performance and lower total\\ncost of ownership than mainframe systems for business critical applications, for customers having more computationally intensive needs, and as platforms for building cloud computing IT environments. Our SPARC servers are also a core component of the\\nOracle SuperCluster, one of our Oracle Engineered Systems.  We also offer enterprise x86 servers. These x86 servers are based on microprocessor\\nplatforms from Intel Corporation and are compatible with Oracle Solaris, Oracle Linux, Microsoft Windows and other operating systems. Our x86 servers are also a core component of many of our Oracle Engineered Systems including Oracle Exadata\\nDatabase Machine, Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud, Oracle Exalytics In-Memory Machine and the Oracle Big Data Appliance.  Our storage products\\nare designed to securely manage, protect, archive and restore customers\\x92 mission critical data assets and consist of tape, disk, flash and hardware-related software including file systems software, back-up and archive software and storage\\nmanagement software and networking for mainframe and open systems environments.  Our networking and data center fabric products, including\\nOracle Virtual Networking, and Oracle InfiniBand and Ethernet technologies, are used with our server and storage products and are integrated into our management tools to help enterprise customers improve infrastructure performance, reduce cost and\\ncomplexity and simplify storage and server connectivity. We also offer hardware and software products and services for communications networks including network signaling, policy control and subscriber data management solutions, and session border\\ncontrol technology, amongst others.  The majority of our hardware systems products are sold through indirect channels, including independent\\ndistributors and value added resellers.  To produce our hardware products, we rely on both our internal manufacturing operations as well as\\nthird party manufacturing partners. Our internal manufacturing operations consist primarily of materials procurement, assembly, testing and quality control of our Oracle Engineered Systems and certain of our enterprise and data center servers and\\nstorage systems. For all other manufacturing, we generally rely on third party manufacturing partners to produce our hardware related components and hardware products and we may involve our internal manufacturing operations in the final assembly,\\ntesting and quality control processes for these components and products. We distribute most of our hardware products either from our facilities or partner facilities. We strive to reduce costs by simplifying our manufacturing processes through\\nincreased standardization of components across product types and a \\x93build-to-order\\x94 manufacturing process in which products generally are built only after customers have placed firm orders. \\n \\xa0 38 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Our hardware systems products revenues, cost of hardware systems products and hardware systems operating\\nmargins that we report are affected by our strategy for and the competitive position of our hardware systems products, the strength of general economic and business conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, certain of our acquisitions and\\nforeign currency rate fluctuations. In addition, our operating margins for our hardware systems products segment have been and will be affected by the amortization of intangible assets.  Our quarterly hardware systems products revenues are difficult to predict. The timing of customer orders and delays in our ability to timely manufacture or deliver a few large hardware transactions could\\nsubstantially affect the amount of hardware systems products revenues, expenses and operating margins that we report.  Hardware Systems\\nSupport:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our hardware systems support offerings provide customers with software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our server, storage and networking products, such as Oracle\\nSolaris and certain other software products, and can include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Typically, our hardware systems support contract arrangements are invoiced to the customer at the beginning of the\\nsupport period and are one year in duration. We continue to evolve hardware systems support processes that are intended to proactively identify and solve quality issues and to increase the amount of new and renewed hardware systems support contracts\\nsold in connection with the sales of our hardware systems products. Our hardware systems support revenues that we report are influenced by a number of factors, including the volume of purchases of hardware products, the mix of hardware products\\npurchased, whether customers decide to purchase hardware systems support contracts at or in close proximity to the time of hardware product sale, the percentage of our hardware systems support contract customer base that renews its support contracts\\nand our acquisitions. Substantially all of these factors are heavily influenced by our customers\\x92 decisions to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware systems\\x92 infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available.\\n Our hardware systems support margins have been and will be affected by certain of our acquisitions and related accounting, including fair\\nvalue adjustments relating to hardware systems support obligations assumed, and by the amortization of intangible assets. As required by business combination accounting rules, we recorded adjustments to reduce our hardware systems support revenues\\nfor contracts assumed from our acquisitions to their estimated fair values. These amounts would have been recorded as hardware systems support revenues by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $11 million, $14 million and\\n$30 million for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. To the extent underlying hardware systems support contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of the hardware systems support\\ncontracts over the respective support periods.  Services Business  \\nOur services business, which represented 10% of our total revenues in fiscal 2014 and 11% in each of fiscal 2013 and 2012, is comprised of the remainder\\nof our operating segments. Our services business has lower margins than our software and cloud and hardware businesses. Our services revenues are impacted by certain of our acquisitions, general economic conditions, governmental budgetary\\nconstraints, personnel reductions in our customers\\x92 IT departments, tighter controls over discretionary spending and the growth in our software and hardware systems products revenues. Our services business\\x92 offerings include: \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n consulting services that are designed to help our customers and global system integrator partners more successfully architect and deploy our products\\nincluding IT strategy alignment, enterprise architecture planning and design, initial product implementation and integration, and ongoing product enhancements and upgrades. We utilize a global, blended delivery model to optimize value for our\\ncustomers and partners, consisting of on-premise consultants from local geographies, industry specialists and consultants from our global delivery and solution centers; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n advanced customer support services, which are provided on-premise and remotely to our customers to enable increased performance and higher availability\\nof their Oracle products and services; and  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n education services for Oracle products and services, including training and certification programs that are offered to customers, partners and\\nemployees through a variety of formats, including instructor-led classes at our education centers, live virtual training, self-paced online training, private events and custom training. \\n \\xa0 39 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Acquisitions  An active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies, products,\\nservices and technologies including Responsys, Inc. (Responsys) and Tekelec Global, Inc. (Tekelec) in fiscal 2014, and Acme Packet, Inc. (Acme Packet) in fiscal 2013, amongst others.  On June\\xa022, 2014, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement) with MICROS Systems, Inc. (MICROS), a provider of integrated software, hardware and services solutions to the\\nhospitality and retail industries. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we will commence a tender offer for the outstanding shares and shares generally representing vested equity incentive awards of MICROS (collectively, MICROS Shares). MICROS\\nshareholders will have the right to tender their MICROS Shares to Oracle in exchange for $68.00 per share in cash upon consummation of the tender offer. The tender offer will commence no later than ten business days from June\\xa022, 2014. After\\ncompletion of the tender offer and subject to certain limited conditions, MICROS will merge with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oracle. In addition, unvested equity awards to acquire MICROS common stock that are outstanding immediately prior\\nto the conclusion of the merger will generally be converted into equity awards denominated in shares of our common stock based on formulas contained in the Merger Agreement. The estimated total purchase price for MICROS is approximately\\n$5.3\\xa0billion. This transaction is conditioned upon (i)\\xa0at least a majority of the MICROS Shares being validly tendered to Oracle, (ii)\\xa0regulatory clearance under the\\xa0Hart-Scott-Rodino\\xa0Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976,\\n(iii)\\xa0the applicable merger control laws of the European Commission and other jurisdictions, and (iv)\\xa0certain other customary closing conditions.  We believe our acquisition program strengthens our competitive position, enhances the products and services that we can offer to customers, expands our customer base, provides greater scale to accelerate\\ninnovation, grows our revenues and earnings and increases stockholder value. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy. Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial\\nStatements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provides additional information related to our pending and recent acquisitions.  We believe\\nwe can fund our pending and future acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. We estimate the\\nfinancial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flow and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Our consolidated financial statements are\\nprepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board\\x92s (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) and consider the various staff accounting bulletins and\\nother applicable guidance issued by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). GAAP, as set forth within the ASC, requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and\\nassumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and\\nliabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results,\\nour financial statements will be affected. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial\\nresults include the following:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Revenue Recognition  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Business Combinations  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Goodwill and Intangible Assets\\x97Impairment Assessments \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Accounting for Income Taxes  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Legal and Other Contingencies  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Stock-Based Compensation \\n \\xa0 40 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and\\ndoes not require management\\x92s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management\\x92s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. Our senior management has reviewed\\nour critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.  Revenue\\nRecognition  Our sources of revenues include: (1)\\xa0software and cloud revenues, including new software licenses revenues earned\\nfrom granting licenses to use our software products; cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues generated from fees for granting customers access to a broad range of our software and related support offerings on a subscription basis in a secure, standards-based\\ncloud computing environment; cloud IaaS revenues generated from fees for deployment and management offerings for our software and hardware and related IT infrastructure generally on a subscription basis; and software license updates and product\\nsupport revenues; (2)\\xa0hardware systems revenues, which include the sale of hardware systems products including computer servers, storage products, networking and data center fabric products, and hardware systems support revenues; and\\n(3)\\xa0services, which includes software and hardware related services including consulting, advanced customer support and education revenues. Revenues generally are recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to\\ngovernmental authorities.  Revenue Recognition for Software Products and Software Related Services (Software Elements) \\nNew software licenses revenues primarily represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database, middleware and application software\\nand exclude cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues and revenues derived from software license updates, which are included in software license updates and product support revenues. The basis for our new software licenses revenue recognition is substantially\\ngoverned by the accounting guidance contained in ASC 985-605, Software-Revenue Recognition. We exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software and software related services revenues to be\\nrecognized in each accounting period.  For software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the\\nunderlying software, we recognize new software licenses revenues when: (1)\\xa0we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software; (2)\\xa0we deliver the products; (3)\\xa0the sale price is fixed or\\ndeterminable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties; and (4)\\xa0collection is probable. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met, are recognized when those conditions are\\nsubsequently met.  Substantially all of our software license arrangements do not include acceptance provisions. However, if acceptance\\nprovisions exist as part of public policy, for example, in agreements with government entities where acceptance periods are required by law, or within previously executed terms and conditions that are referenced in the current agreement and are\\nshort-term in nature, we generally recognize revenues upon delivery provided the acceptance terms are perfunctory and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. If acceptance provisions are not perfunctory (for example, acceptance\\nprovisions that are long-term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement), revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period. \\nThe vast majority of our software license arrangements include software license updates and product support contracts, which are entered into at the\\ncustomer\\x92s option and are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement, typically one year. Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during\\nthe term of the support period. Product support includes internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel. Software license updates and product support contracts are generally priced as a\\npercentage of the net new software licenses fees. Substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually.  Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements\\x97Software Products and Software Related Services (Software Arrangements)  We often enter into arrangements with customers that purchase both software related products and software related services from us at the same time, or within close proximity of one another (referred to\\nas software related multiple-element arrangements). Such software related multiple-element arrangements include the sale of our software products, software license updates and product support contracts and other software related services whereby\\nsoftware license delivery is followed by the subsequent or contemporaneous delivery of the other elements. For those software related multiple-element arrangements, we have applied the residual method to\\n\\n \\xa0 41 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\ndetermine the amount of new software license revenues to be recognized pursuant to ASC 985-605. Under the residual method, if fair value exists for undelivered elements in a multiple-element\\narrangement, such fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred with the remaining portion of the arrangement consideration generally recognized upon delivery of the software license. We allocate the fair value of each element of a software\\nrelated multiple-element arrangement based upon its fair value as determined by our vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE\\x97described further below), with any remaining amount allocated to the software license. \\nRevenue Recognition for Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS Offerings, Hardware Systems Products, Hardware Systems Support and Related Services (Nonsoftware\\nElements)  Our revenue recognition policy for nonsoftware deliverables including cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, hardware systems\\nproducts and hardware systems related services is based upon the accounting guidance contained in ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition, Multiple-Element Arrangements, and we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the\\ndetermination of the amount of cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues, hardware systems products revenues and hardware related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period.  Revenues from the sales of our nonsoftware elements are recognized when: (1)\\xa0persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2)\\xa0we deliver the products and passage of the title to the buyer\\noccurs; (3)\\xa0the sale price is fixed or determinable; and (4)\\xa0collection is reasonably assured. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met are recognized when those conditions are\\nsubsequently met. When applicable, we reduce revenues for estimated returns or certain other incentive programs where we have the ability to sufficiently estimate the effects of these items. Where an arrangement is subject to acceptance criteria and\\nthe acceptance provisions are not perfunctory (for example, acceptance provisions that are long-term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement), revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer\\nacceptance or expiration of the acceptance period.  Our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings generally provide customers access to certain of our\\nsoftware within a cloud-based IT environment that we manage and offer to customers on a subscription basis. Revenues for our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings are generally recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date our service\\nis made available to customers and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied.  Our cloud IaaS offerings provide deployment and\\nmanagement offerings for our software and hardware and related IT infrastructure including comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services arrangements for customer IT infrastructure for a stated term that is hosted at our\\ndata center facilities, select partner data centers or physically on-premise at customer facilities generally for a term-based fee; and virtual machine instances that are subscription-based and designed for computing and reliable and secure object\\nstorage. Revenues for these cloud IaaS offerings are generally recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date the service is made available to customers and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. Our cloud\\nIaaS offerings also include our Oracle Engineered Systems hardware and related support that are deployed on-premise in our customers\\x92 data centers for a monthly fee and provide for the purchase of additional capacity on demand. Our revenue\\nrecognition policy for these on-premise offerings is in accordance with ASC 605 and ASC 840, Leases, and substantially all of these offerings are accounted for as operating leases as our contracts are structured so that the term of the\\narrangement is less than 75% of the economic life of the equipment and the present value of the minimum fixed payments are less than 90% of the fair market value of the equipment at the inception of the arrangement. Our evaluation of useful life is\\nbased on our historical product development cycles and our historical customer hardware upgrade cycles. Capacity on demand is a contingent payment and is therefore excluded from our assessment of the net present value of fixed payments. Revenue for\\ncapacity on demand is recognized in the period our customers access additional capacity provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.  Revenues from the sale of hardware systems products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of computer servers, storage, and networking products, including the sales of our Oracle Engineered\\nSystems.  Our hardware systems support offerings generally provide customers with software updates for the software components that are\\nessential to the functionality of our server and storage products and can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware systems support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware\\nsystems products fees. Hardware systems support contracts are entered \\n \\xa0 42 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\ninto at the customer\\x92s option and are recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangements, which are typically one year. \\nRevenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements\\x97Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS Offerings, Hardware Systems Products, Hardware Systems Support\\nand Related Services (Nonsoftware Arrangements)  We enter into arrangements with customers that purchase both nonsoftware related products\\nand services from us at the same time, or within close proximity of one another (referred to as nonsoftware multiple-element arrangements). Each element within a nonsoftware multiple-element arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of\\naccounting provided the following criteria are met: the delivered products or services have value to the customer on a standalone basis; and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services,\\ndelivery or performance of the undelivered product or service is considered probable and is substantially controlled by us. We consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by us or another vendor or\\ncould be resold by the customer. Further, our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products. Where the aforementioned criteria for a separate unit of accounting are not met, the\\ndeliverable is combined with the undelivered element(s) and treated as a single unit of accounting for the purposes of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition. For those units of accounting that include more than one\\ndeliverable but are treated as a single unit of accounting, we generally recognize revenues over the delivery period or in the case of our cloud offerings, generally over the estimated customer relationship period. For the purposes of revenue\\nclassification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we allocate revenue to the respective revenue line items within our consolidated statements of operations based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing\\nour best estimate of relative selling prices of such elements.  For our nonsoftware multiple-element arrangements, we allocate revenue to each\\nelement based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangement\\x92s inception. The selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy: VSOE if available, third party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or\\nestimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE are available (a description as to how we determine VSOE, TPE and ESP is provided below). If a tangible hardware systems product includes software, we determine whether the tangible hardware\\nsystems product and the software work together to deliver the product\\x92s essential functionality and, if so, the entire product is treated as a nonsoftware deliverable. The total arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of\\naccounting for each of the nonsoftware deliverables using the relative selling prices of each unit based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. We limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to an amount that is not\\ncontingent upon future delivery of additional products or services or meeting of any specified performance conditions.  When possible, we\\nestablish VSOE of selling price for deliverables in software and nonsoftware multiple-element arrangements using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and for software license updates and product support and hardware systems\\nsupport, based on the renewal rates offered to customers. TPE is established by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated customers. If we are unable to determine the\\nselling price because VSOE or TPE does not exist, we determine ESP for the purposes of allocating the arrangement by reviewing historical transactions, including transactions whereby the deliverable was sold on a standalone basis and considering\\nseveral other external and internal factors including, but not limited to, pricing practices including discounting, margin objectives, competition, contractually stated prices, the geographies in which we offer our products and services, the type of\\ncustomer (i.e., distributor, value added reseller, government agency and direct end user, among others) and the stage of the product lifecycle. The determination of ESP is made through consultation with and approval by our management, taking into\\nconsideration our pricing model and go-to-market strategy. As our, or our competitors\\x92, pricing and go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes to our determination of VSOE,\\nTPE and ESP. As a result, our future revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements could differ materially from our results in the current period. Selling prices are analyzed on an annual basis or more frequently if we experience significant\\nchanges in our selling prices. \\n \\xa0 43 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to both Software and Nonsoftware Elements \\nRevenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements\\x97Arrangements with Software and Nonsoftware Elements \\nWe also enter into multiple-element arrangements that may include a combination of our various software related and nonsoftware related products and\\nservices offerings including new software licenses, software license updates and product support, cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, hardware systems products, hardware systems support, consulting, advanced customer support services and education.\\nIn such arrangements, we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative selling prices of the software group of elements as a whole and to the nonsoftware elements. We then further allocate consideration within the software\\ngroup to the respective elements within that group following the guidance in ASC 985-605 and our policies as described above. After the arrangement consideration has been allocated to the elements, we account for each respective element in the\\narrangement as described above.  Other Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to Software and Nonsoftware Elements \\nMany of our software arrangements include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts and are included as a\\npart of our services business. Consulting revenues from these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from new software licenses revenues because the arrangements qualify as services transactions as defined in ASC 985-605. The more\\nsignificant factors considered in determining whether the revenues should be accounted for separately include the nature of services (i.e., consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product), degree of\\nrisk, availability of services from other vendors, timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee. Revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are\\nperformed. If there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services, revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved. We estimate the proportional performance on\\ncontracts with fixed or \\x93not to exceed\\x94 fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project. If we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion,\\nrevenues are recognized when we receive final acceptance from the customer that the services have been completed. When total cost estimates exceed revenues, we accrue for the estimated losses immediately using cost estimates that are based upon an\\naverage fully burdened daily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the services. The complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the\\nproportional performance method of accounting affects the amounts of revenues and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements. A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates, including labor rates,\\nutilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes.  Our advanced customer support services are offered as\\nstandalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying other software and non-software products and services. We offer these advanced support services, both on-premise and remote, to Oracle customers to enable increased performance\\nand higher availability of their products and services. Depending upon the nature of the arrangement, revenues from these services are recognized as the services are performed or ratably over the term of the service period, which is generally one\\nyear or less.  Education revenues are also a part of our services business and include instructor-led, media-based and internet-based training\\nin the use of our software and hardware products. Education revenues are recognized as the classes or other education offerings are delivered. \\nIf an arrangement contains multiple elements and does not qualify for separate accounting for the product and service transactions, then new software\\nlicenses revenues and/or hardware systems products revenues, including the costs of hardware systems products, are generally recognized together with the services based on contract accounting using either the percentage-of-completion or\\ncompleted-contract method. Contract accounting is applied to any bundled software and cloud, hardware systems and services arrangements: (1)\\xa0that include milestones or customer specific acceptance criteria that may affect collection of the\\nsoftware license or hardware systems product fees; (2)\\xa0where consulting services include significant modification or customization of the software or hardware systems product or are of a specialized nature and generally performed only by\\nOracle; \\n \\xa0 44 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\n(3)\\xa0where significant consulting services are provided for in the software license contract or hardware systems product contract without additional charge or are substantially discounted; or\\n(4)\\xa0where the software license or hardware systems product payment is tied to the performance of consulting services. For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we allocate\\nrevenues to software and nonsoftware elements based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of the relative selling price of such elements.  We also evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing \\x93fiscal funding\\x94 or \\x93termination for convenience\\x94 provisions, when such provisions are required by law, to determine\\nthe probability of possible cancellation. We consider multiple factors, including the history with the customer in similar transactions, the \\x93essential use\\x94 of the software or hardware systems products and the planning, budgeting and\\napproval processes undertaken by the governmental entity. If we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is remote, we then recognize revenues once all of the criteria described above have been met. If such\\na determination cannot be made, revenues are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity.  We assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenues if all other revenue recognition requirements are met. Our standard payment terms are net 30 days. However,\\npayment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed. Payments that are due within six months are generally deemed to be fixed or determinable based on our successful collection history on such arrangements, and thereby\\nsatisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition.  While most of our arrangements for sales within our businesses include short-term\\npayment terms, we have a standard practice of providing long-term financing to creditworthy customers primarily through our financing division. Since fiscal 1989, when our financing division was formed, we have established a history of collection,\\nwithout concessions, on these receivables with payment terms that generally extend up to five years from the contract date. Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, we recognize new software licenses revenues and hardware\\nsystems products revenues for these arrangements upon delivery, net of any payment discounts from financing transactions. We have generally sold receivables financed through our financing division on a non-recourse basis to third party financing\\ninstitutions within 90 days of the contracts\\x92 dates of execution and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We account for the sales of these receivables\\nas \\x93true sales\\x94 as defined in ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing, as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables.  In addition, we enter into arrangements with leasing companies for the sale of our hardware systems products. These leasing companies, in turn, lease our products to end-users. The leasing companies\\ngenerally have no recourse to us in the event of default by the end-user and we recognize revenue upon delivery, if all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.  Our customers include several of our suppliers and occasionally, we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendors at or about the same time that we have sold our products to these\\nsame companies (Concurrent Transactions). Software license agreements or sales of hardware systems that occur within a three-month time period from the date we have purchased goods or services from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate\\naccounting treatment and disclosure. When we acquire goods or services from a customer, we negotiate the purchase separately from any sales transaction, at terms we consider to be at arm\\x92s length and settle the purchase in cash. We recognize\\nrevenues from Concurrent Transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are met and the goods and services acquired are necessary for our current operations.  Business Combinations  We apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business\\nCombinations, in the accounting for our acquisitions. It requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as\\nthe excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed\\nat the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we\\nrecord adjustments to the assets \\n \\xa0 45 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nacquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities\\nassumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations.  Accounting for business\\ncombinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date including our estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, restructuring liabilities, pre-acquisition\\ncontingencies and contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained\\nfrom the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.  Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the\\nintangible assets we have acquired include but are not limited to:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n future expected cash flows from software license sales, cloud SaaS and PaaS contracts, hardware systems product sales, support agreements, consulting\\ncontracts, other customer contracts, acquired developed technologies and patents;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when\\ncompleted;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n the acquired company\\x92s brand and competitive position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used\\nin the combined company\\x92s product portfolio; and  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n discount rates. \\nUnanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. \\nWe estimate the fair values of our cloud SaaS and PaaS (collectively, cloud software subscriptions), software license updates and product support, and\\nhardware systems support obligations assumed. The estimated fair values of these performance obligations are determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to\\nfulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. The estimated costs to fulfill the obligations are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services including the correction of any errors in the products acquired. The\\nsum of these costs and operating profit approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the performance obligations. We do not include any costs associated with selling efforts or research and development\\nor the related fulfillment margins on these costs. Profit associated with any selling efforts is excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded those selling efforts on the performance obligations prior to the acquisition date. We also\\ndo not include the estimated research and development costs in our fair value determinations, as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition. As a result, we did not recognize cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues\\nrelated to cloud SaaS and PaaS contracts in the amounts of $17 million, $45 million and $22 million that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We did not\\nrecognize software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts in the amounts of $3 million, $14\\xa0million and $48 million that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in\\nfiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In addition, we did not recognize hardware systems support revenues related to hardware systems support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in\\nthe amounts of $11 million, $14 million and $30 million for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Historically, substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software license updates and product\\nsupport contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal and we strive to renew cloud SaaS and PaaS and hardware systems support contracts. To the extent cloud SaaS and PaaS, software support or hardware systems support contracts are renewed,\\nwe will recognize the revenues for the full values of the contracts over the contracts\\x92 periods, which are generally one year in duration. \\nIn connection with a business combination or other strategic initiative, we may estimate costs associated with restructuring plans committed to by our\\nmanagement. Restructuring costs are typically comprised of employee severance costs, costs of consolidating duplicate facilities and contract termination costs. Restructuring expenses are based upon plans that have been committed to by our\\nmanagement, but may be refined in subsequent periods. \\n \\xa0 46 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nWe account for costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company separately from the business combination pursuant to ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations. A\\nliability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred. When estimating the fair value of facility\\nrestructuring activities, assumptions are applied regarding estimated sub-lease payments to be received, which can differ materially from actual results. This may require us to revise our initial estimates which may materially affect our results of\\noperations and financial position in the period the revision is made.  For a given acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition\\ncontingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as\\na part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts.  If we cannot\\nreasonably determine the fair value of a pre-acquisition contingency (non-income tax related) by the end of the measurement period, which is generally the case given the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such\\npre-acquisition contingency if: (i)\\xa0it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and (ii)\\xa0the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent to the measurement\\nperiod, changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position.  In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items\\nquarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or\\nour final determination of the tax allowance\\x92s or contingency\\x92s estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our\\nconsolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.  Goodwill and\\nIntangible Assets\\x97Impairment Assessments   We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes\\nin circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles\\x97Goodwill and Other. According to ASC 350, we can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting unit\\x92s goodwill\\nfor impairment or we can directly perform the two step impairment test. Based on our qualitative assessment, if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) to be less than\\nits carrying amount, the two step impairment test will be performed. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets\\nassigned to that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform\\nthe second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit\\x92s goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit\\x92s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we would record an impairment\\nloss equal to the difference.  Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These\\nestimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables. We\\nbase our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating\\nshared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units. Our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis, which was performed on March\\xa01, 2014, did not result in a goodwill impairment charge, nor did\\nwe record any goodwill impairment in fiscal 2013 or 2012. Our consulting and hardware systems products reporting units have experienced revenues and operating margin declines in fiscal 2014 as compared to prior years. As a result, our consulting and\\nhardware systems products reporting units may be at greater risk for goodwill impairment than our other reporting units if our actual results for these reporting units differ from our projections. \\n \\xa0 47 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or\\nchanges in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of\\namortization. Recoverability of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. We review indefinite lived intangible assets for\\nimpairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to its fair\\nvalue. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset.  Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long-lived assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including\\nexternal factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Although we believe the historical assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate,\\ndifferent assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results. We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2014, 2013 or 2012.  Accounting for Income Taxes  Significant judgment is required in determining our\\nworldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost\\nreimbursement arrangements among related entities, the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment and segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation. Although\\nwe believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income\\ntax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made.  Our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain\\nundistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Remittances of foreign earnings to the United States are planned based on projected\\ncash flow, working capital and investment needs of our foreign and domestic operations. Based on these assumptions, we estimate the amount that will be distributed to the United States and provide U.S. federal taxes on these amounts. Material\\nchanges in our estimates as to how much of our foreign earnings will be distributed to the United States or tax legislation that limits or restricts the amount of undistributed foreign earnings that we consider indefinitely reinvested outside the\\nUnited States could materially impact our income tax provision and effective tax rate.  We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred\\ntax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We\\nconsider future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law and prudent and feasible\\ntax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets\\nvaluation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination, or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period. If we\\nlater determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to earnings at such time. \\nWe calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax\\nreturns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known, which can materially impact our effective tax rate.\\n The amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed\\nassessments. Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly \\n \\xa0 48 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\njudgmental. A description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under \\x93Business Combinations\\x94\\nabove. For those tax related contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we account for these uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740, Income Taxes, which contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain\\ntax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit, including resolution of\\nany related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain\\ntax positions, no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, judicial rulings, and\\nrefinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences generally will impact our provision for\\nincome taxes in the period in which such a determination is made. Our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties.\\n In addition, as a part of our accounting for business combinations, intangible assets are recognized at fair values and goodwill is measured\\nas the excess of consideration transferred over the net estimated fair values of assets acquired. Impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period\\nthat any impairment is recorded. Amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible pursuant to our existing tax structure; however, deferred taxes have been recorded for non-deductible amortization\\nexpenses as a part of the accounting for business combinations. We have taken into account the allocation of these identified intangibles among different taxing jurisdictions, including those with nominal or zero percent tax rates, in establishing\\nthe related deferred tax liabilities.  Legal and Other Contingencies  We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. A description of our accounting\\npolicies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under \\x93Business Combinations\\x94 above. For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we accrue a liability for\\nan estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to\\nwhether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time the accruals are made. As additional information becomes available,\\nwe reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial\\nposition.  Stock-Based Compensation  We account for share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, restricted stock-based awards and purchases under employee stock purchase plans, in accordance with ASC 718,\\nCompensation\\x97Stock Compensation, which requires that share-based payments (to the extent they are compensatory) be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values. We recognize stock-based compensation\\nexpense on a straight-line basis over the service period of the award, which is generally four years.  We are required to estimate the stock\\nawards that we ultimately expect to vest and to reduce stock-based compensation expense for the effects of estimated forfeitures of awards over the expense recognition period. Although we estimate the rate of future forfeitures based upon historical\\nexperience, actual forfeitures in the future may differ. To the extent our actual forfeitures are different than our estimates, we record a true-up for the difference in the period that the awards vest and such true-ups could materially affect our\\noperating results. Additionally, we also consider on a quarterly basis whether there have been any significant changes in facts and circumstances that would affect our expected forfeiture rate. \\n \\xa0 49 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n We estimate the fair values of employee stock options using a Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. The fair\\nvalue of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold\\ntheir stock options. The risk-free interest rate assumption we use is based upon U.S. treasury interest rates appropriate for the expected life of the awards. We use the implied volatility of publicly traded options in our stock in order to estimate\\nfuture stock price trends as we believe that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. In order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options,\\nwe have used historical rates of employee groups by seniority of job classification. Our expected dividend rate is based upon an annualized dividend yield based on the per share dividend declared by our Board of Directors. The aforementioned inputs\\nentered into the option valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective estimates and changes to these estimates will cause the fair values of our stock awards and related stock-based compensation expense that we record to vary.\\n We record deferred tax assets for stock-based compensation awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns, based on the amount of\\nstock-based compensation recognized and the fair values attributable to the vested portion of stock awards assumed in connection with a business combination, at the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a tax deduction.\\nBecause the deferred tax assets we record are based upon the stock-based compensation expenses in a particular jurisdiction, the aforementioned inputs that affect the fair values of our stock awards may also indirectly affect our income tax expense.\\nIn addition, differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on our income tax returns are recorded in additional paid-in capital. If the tax deduction is less than the\\ndeferred tax asset, the calculated shortfall reduces our pool of excess tax benefits. If the pool of excess tax benefits is reduced to zero, then subsequent shortfalls would increase our income tax expense. \\nTo the extent we change the terms of our employee stock-based compensation programs, experience market volatility in the pricing of our common stock that\\nincreases the implied volatility calculation of publicly traded options in our stock, refine different assumptions in future periods such as forfeiture rates that differ from our current estimates, or assume stock awards from acquired companies that\\nare different in nature than our stock award arrangements, among other potential impacts, the stock-based compensation expense that we record in future periods and the tax benefits that we realize may differ significantly from what we have recorded\\nin previous reporting periods.  Results of Operations  Impact of Acquisitions  The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2014\\ncompared to fiscal 2013 is impacted by our acquisitions, primarily our acquisitions of Responsys in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, Tekelec in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and Acme Packet in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. \\nThe comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 is impacted by our acquisitions, primarily our acquisitions of Acme\\nPacket in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, Taleo Corporation (Taleo) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and RightNow Technologies, Inc. (RightNow) during the third quarter of fiscal 2012.  In our discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012, we may qualitatively disclose the impacts of our acquired\\nproducts (for the one year period subsequent to the acquisition date) to the growth in our new software licenses revenues, cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues, software license updates and product support revenues, hardware systems products revenues and\\nhardware systems support revenues where such qualitative discussions would be meaningful for an understanding of the factors that influenced the changes in our results of operations. When material, we may also provide quantitative disclosures\\nrelated to such acquired products. The contributions of our acquisitions to our other businesses and operating segments\\x92 revenues and to the expense contributions for substantially all of our businesses and operating segments in each of the\\nrespective period comparisons are not provided as they either were not separately identifiable due to the integration of these businesses and operating segments into our existing operations and/or were insignificant to our results of operations\\nduring the periods presented. \\n \\xa0 50 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n We caution readers that, while pre- and post-acquisition comparisons, as well as any quantified amounts\\nthemselves, may provide indications of general trends, the acquisition information that we provide has inherent limitations for the following reasons:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n any qualitative and quantitative disclosures cannot specifically address or quantify the substantial effects attributable to changes in business\\nstrategies, including our sales force integration efforts. We believe that if our acquired companies had operated independently and sales forces had not been integrated, the relative mix of products sold would have been different; and\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n although substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software license updates and product support\\ncontracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal and we strive to renew cloud SaaS and PaaS contracts and hardware systems support contracts, the amounts shown as cloud software-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service deferred revenues, software\\nlicense updates and product support deferred revenues, and hardware systems support deferred revenues in our supplemental disclosure related to certain charges (presented below) are not necessarily indicative of revenue improvements we will achieve\\nupon contract renewals to the extent customers do not renew.  Constant Currency Presentation \\nOur international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues and expenses. As a result, total\\nrevenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S.\\xa0Dollar against major international currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign\\ncurrency fluctuations, we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Annual Report using constant currency disclosure. To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities\\nreporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e., the rates in effect on May\\xa031, 2013, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year) rather than the actual exchange rates in\\neffect during the respective periods. For example, if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0\\xa0million Euros from products sold on May\\xa031, 2014 and 2013, our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of $1.36 million in\\nfiscal 2014 (using 1.36 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period) and $1.29 million in fiscal 2013 (using 1.29 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period). The constant currency presentation would translate the fiscal 2014\\nresults using the fiscal 2013 exchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during the period. In each of the tables below, we present the percent change based on actual, unrounded results in reported currency and in constant\\ncurrency. \\n \\xa0 51 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n

constant currency basis, our total revenues increased in fiscal 2014 by 4\\npercentage points due to increases in our software and cloud business revenues and our hardware business revenues, partially offset by a decrease in our services business revenues. The constant currency growth in our software and cloud business was\\nsubstantially attributable to growth in our software license updates and product support revenues and, to a lesser extent, our cloud software-as-a-service (SaaS) and platform-as-a-service (PaaS) revenues due to incremental revenues from our\\nacquisitions. The constant currency revenues growth in our hardware business was due to an increase in our hardware systems support revenues due substantially to incremental revenues from our acquisitions and due to increases in our hardware\\nrevenues attributable to our Oracle Engineered Systems, partially offset by revenue decreases attributable to reductions in the sales volumes of certain of our legacy hardware product lines, including lower margin products. On a constant currency\\nbasis, the Americas contributed 61%, EMEA contributed 30% and Asia Pacific contributed 9% to our total revenues growth during fiscal 2014.  Total constant currency operating expenses increased during fiscal 2014 primarily due to an increase in sales and marketing and research and development expenses resulting from increased headcount, higher\\nsales-based variable compensation expenses due to revenues growth, and an increase in cloud SaaS and PaaS costs resulting from additional expenses incurred to support the increases in our cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues. These expense increases in\\nfiscal 2014 were partially offset by lower constant currency expenses from our hardware systems support and services segments due to decreased headcount, lower restructuring expenses, and lower intangible assets amortization. In fiscal 2013, we\\nrecognized a $387 million acquisition related benefit (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information) and a $306 million benefit relating to certain litigation (see Note\\n18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information), both of which decreased our acquisition related and other expenses during this period. \\nExcluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations, our operating margin increased during fiscal 2014 due to our revenues growth, while our\\noperating margin as a percentage of revenues was flat. \\n \\xa0 52 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Excluding the effect of foreign\\ncurrency rate fluctuations, our total revenues increased in fiscal 2013 due to an increase in our software and cloud business revenues. This constant currency increase was partially offset by reductions in our hardware systems and services\\nbusiness\\x92 revenues. On a constant currency basis, the Americas region contributed 77% and the Asia Pacific region contributed 23% to our growth in total revenues during fiscal 2013.  Excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations, total operating expenses decreased in fiscal 2013 primarily due to a $387 million acquisition related benefit and a $306 million benefit related\\nto certain litigation (both as noted above), lower hardware systems products costs associated with lower hardware systems products revenues, and certain other operating expense decreases in most of our other lines of business primarily due to lower\\nvariable compensation expenses, lower external contractor expenses and lower amortization of intangible assets. In constant currency, these total expense decreases during fiscal 2013 were partially offset by higher salary and benefit expenses due\\nprimarily to additional sales and marketing and research and development headcount added during fiscal 2013.  Excluding the effect of foreign\\ncurrency rate fluctuations, our total operating margin and our total operating margin as a percentage of total revenues increased during fiscal 2013 due to the increase in our total revenues and the decrease in our total operating expenses.\\n Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges  To supplement our consolidated financial information, we believe the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future.

revenues increased by 3% during fiscal 2014 primarily due to incremental revenues from our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings resulting from our recent acquisitions. In constant currency, total new\\nsoftware licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues growth in the Americas and EMEA region was partially offset by a decline in revenues in the Asia Pacific region.  In constant currency, our new software license revenues increased by 1% in fiscal 2014 and our SaaS and PaaS revenues increased by 24% in fiscal 2014, both primarily due to incremental revenues from our\\nrecent acquisitions.  As a result of our acquisitions, we recorded adjustments to reduce assumed cloud SaaS and PaaS obligations to their\\nestimated fair values at the acquisition dates. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues in the amounts of $17 million, $45 million and $22 million that would have been otherwise recorded by our\\nacquired businesses as independent entities were not recognized in fiscal 2014, \\n \\xa0 55 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\n2013 and 2012, respectively. To the extent underlying cloud SaaS and PaaS contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of the cloud\\nSaaS and PaaS contracts over the respective contractual periods.  In reported currency, new software licenses revenues earned from transactions\\nof $3 million or greater increased by 3% in fiscal 2014 and represented 33% of our new software licenses revenues in fiscal 2014 in comparison to 32% in fiscal 2013.  Excluding the effect of favorable currency rate fluctuations, total new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions expenses increased in fiscal 2014 primarily due to higher employee related\\nexpenses from increased headcount, higher variable compensation expenses due to revenues growth, and higher cloud SaaS and PaaS expenses resulting from costs incurred to support the related revenue increases. \\nExcluding the effect of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations, total new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions margin and margin as a\\npercentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2014 as our total expenses increased at a faster rate than our total revenues for this operating segment.  Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations, total new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues\\nincreased during fiscal 2013 due to growth across all regions and incremental revenues from our acquisitions. On a constant currency basis, the Americas contributed 69%, EMEA contributed 23% and Asia Pacific contributed 8% to the increase in new\\nsoftware licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues during fiscal 2013.  In constant currency, our new software licenses revenues\\nincreased by 1% and our cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues increased by 100% in fiscal 2013 primarily due to incremental revenues from our acquisitions. As described above, the amount of new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues that\\nwe recognized in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 were affected by business combination accounting rules.  In reported currency, new software\\nlicenses revenues earned from transactions of $3 million or greater increased by 11% in fiscal 2013 and represented 32% of our total new software licenses revenues in fiscal 2013 in comparison to 29% in fiscal 2012. \\nExcluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions expenses increased in fiscal 2013\\nprimarily due to higher employee related expenses and stock-based compensation from increased headcount, and higher intangible asset amortization, partially offset by a decrease in certain legal costs. \\nExcluding the effect of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations, total new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions margin and margin as a\\npercentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2013 as our total expenses increased at a faster rate than our total revenues for this operating segment.  Cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our cloud infrastructure-as-a-service segment provides deployment and management offerings for our software and hardware and related\\nIT infrastructure including virtual machine instances that are subscription-based and designed for computing and reliable and secure object storage; Oracle Engineered Systems hardware and related support that are deployed in our customers\\x92 data\\ncenters for a monthly fee; and comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services for customer IT infrastructure for a fee for a stated term that is hosted at our data center facilities, select partner data centers or physically\\non-premise at customer facilities. Cloud infrastructure-as-a-service expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenditures, technology infrastructure expenditures and facilities costs. For all periods presented, our\\ncloud-infrastructure-as-a-service segment\\x92s revenues and expenses were substantially attributable to our IT infrastructure management, maintenance and hosting

operations \\nFiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Excluding the effect of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations, software license\\nupdates and product support revenues increased by 7% in fiscal 2014 as a result of new software licenses sold with substantially all of these customers electing to purchase software support contracts during the trailing 4-quarter period, and the\\nrenewal of substantially all of the software support customer base eligible for renewal during the trailing 4-quarter period. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 55%, EMEA contributed 30% and Asia Pacific\\ncontributed 15% to the increase in software license updates and product support revenues.  As a result of our acquisitions, we\\nrecorded adjustments to reduce assumed software support obligations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, software license updates and product support revenues\\nrelated to software support contracts in the amounts of $3\\xa0million, $14 million and $48 million that would have been otherwise recorded by our acquired businesses as independent entities were not recognized in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012,\\nrespectively. Historically, substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software support contracts when such contracts are eligible for renewal. To the extent these underlying support contracts are\\nrenewed, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of these contracts over the support periods, the substantial majority of which are one year in duration.  Excluding the effect of favorable foreign currency rate fluctuations, total software license updates and product support expenses during fiscal 2014 decreased slightly due to a modest decrease in\\nheadcount and a decrease in amortization of intangible assets. Margin and margin as a percentage of revenues increased during fiscal 2014 as our total revenues for this segment increased while our total expenses slightly decreased. \\nFiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, software license updates and\\nproduct support revenues increased in fiscal 2013 for similar reasons as those noted above for our fiscal 2014 revenues increase and due to incremental revenues from recent acquisitions. Excluding the effect of currency rate\\nfluctuations, the Americas contributed 56%, EMEA contributed 29% and Asia Pacific contributed 15% to the increase in software license updates and product support revenues.  As described above, the amounts of software license updates and product support revenues that we recognized in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 were affected by business combination accounting rules.\\n\\n \\xa0 58 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Excluding the effect of favorable foreign currency rate fluctuations, total software license updates and\\nproduct support expenses decreased in fiscal 2013 primarily due to lower amortization of intangible assets, a reduction in certain non-income based taxes, lower bad debt expenses, and lower variable compensation expenses. \\nExcluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total software license updates and product support margin and margin as a percentage of revenues\\nincreased in fiscal 2013 as our total revenues for this segment increased while our total expenses decreased.  Hardware Systems Business\\n Our hardware systems business consists of our hardware systems products segment and hardware systems support segment. \\nHardware Systems Products:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Hardware systems products revenues are primarily generated from the sales of our computer\\nserver, storage and networking products, including sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems. We market and sell our hardware systems products through our direct sales force and indirect channels such as independent distributors and value added\\nresellers. Operating expenses associated with our hardware systems products include the cost of hardware systems products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our internal manufacturing operations or\\nby third party manufacturers, warranty expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the impact of inventory determined to be excess and obsolete. Operating expenses associated with our hardware systems products also\\ninclude sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include variable compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of our hardware products, and amortization of intangible assets.

operations \\nFiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Excluding the impact of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations, hardware systems\\nsupport revenues increased in fiscal 2014 primarily due to incremental revenues from our \\n \\xa0 60 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nrecent acquisitions. These hardware support revenues increases were partially offset by certain hardware support revenues decreases that were generally caused by the reductions in sales volumes\\nof certain of our legacy hardware systems product lines for which we offer hardware systems support. In constant currency, hardware systems support revenues growth in the Americas and Asia Pacific region was partially offset by a decline in revenues\\nin the EMEA region.  As a result of our acquisitions, we recorded adjustments to reduce assumed hardware systems support obligations to their\\nestimated fair values at the acquisition dates. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, hardware systems support revenues related to hardware systems support contracts in the amounts of $11\\xa0million, $14 million and $30\\nmillion that would have been otherwise reported by our acquired businesses as independent entities were not recognized in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. To the extent these underlying hardware systems support contracts are renewed, we\\nwill recognize the revenues for the full values of these contracts over the future support periods.  Total hardware systems support expenses\\ndecreased in fiscal 2014 primarily due to a reduction in employee related expenses attributable to decreased headcount and reduced service delivery costs due to operational initiatives, partially offset by an increase in amortization of intangible\\nassets.  Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware systems support margin and margin as a percentage of total revenues\\nincreased in fiscal 2014 as our total revenues for this segment increased while our total expenses for this segment decreased.  Fiscal\\n2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Excluding the impact of currency rate fluctuations, hardware systems support revenues decreased in fiscal 2013 primarily due to reductions in sales volumes of certain of our legacy\\nhardware systems product lines for which we offer hardware systems support. As described above, the amounts of hardware systems support revenues that we recognized in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 were affected by business combination accounting\\nrules.  Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware systems support expenses decreased in fiscal 2013 primarily due to a\\nreduction in employee related expenses attributable to decreased headcount, reduced service delivery costs due to operational initiatives, lower bad debt expenses, and lower amortization of intangible assets. \\nExcluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware systems support margin and margin as a percentage of total revenues increased in fiscal\\n2013 due to the reduction in our total hardware systems support expenses.  Services Business \\nOur services business consists of consulting, advanced customer support services and education services. Consulting revenues are earned by providing\\nservices to customers in business and IT strategy alignment, enterprise architecture planning and design, initial product implementation and integration, and ongoing product enhancements and upgrades. Advanced customer support services are provided\\non-premise and remotely to our customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their Oracle products and services. Education revenues are earned by providing instructor-led, media-based, internet-based and custom training in the\\nuse of our software and hardware offerings. The cost of providing our services consists primarily of personnel related expenses, technology infrastructure expenditures, facilities expenses and external contractor expenses. \\n \\xa0 61

The Venezuelan economy has been determined to be \\x93highly inflationary\\x94 in accordance with ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters. As a result, we report all\\nnet monetary assets related to our Venezuelan subsidiary in U.S. Dollars with the associated impacts of periodic changes of Bolivar Fuerte (\\x93VEF\\x94) to U.S.\\xa0Dollar exchange rates in our statements of operations for each respective\\nreporting period. During fiscal 2014, the Venezuelan government issued new exchange agreements that allowed for certain foreign currency transactions, which previously were subject to Venezuela\\x92s official Bolivar Fuerte (\\x93VEF\\x94) to\\nU.S.\\xa0Dollar exchange rate (the \\x93Official Rate\\x94), to be subject to conversion at rates established at the Venezuelan government\\x92s auction-based exchange rate programs, the Complementary System for Foreign Currency Administration\\n(\\x93SICAD\\x94) rates. These SICAD rates were lower than the Official Rate that we had used historically to report the VEF based transactions and net monetary assets of our \\n \\xa0 65 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nVenezuelan subsidiary. To determine which of the various VEF rates to use during fiscal 2014, we evaluated our individual facts and circumstances taking into consideration our legal ability to\\nconvert VEF at or to settle VEF based transactions using the SICAD rates, amongst other factors. We concluded that using the SICAD rates was the most appropriate for our reporting of our Venezuelan subsidiary\\x92s VEF based transactions and net\\nmonetary assets in U.S. Dollars, which resulted in the $213 million of fiscal 2014 remeasurement losses referenced above. Future devaluations of the Venezuelan currency are not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial\\nstatements. As a large portion of our consolidated operations are international, we could experience additional foreign currency volatility and incur additional remeasurement losses in the future, the amounts and timing of which are unknown.\\n Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0On a constant currency basis, our non-operating income, net\\ndecreased in fiscal 2013 primarily due to an increase in foreign currency transaction losses, net, that included a foreign currency loss relating to our Venezuelan subsidiary\\x92s operations. During our third quarter of fiscal 2013, the Venezuelan\\ngovernment devalued its currency and we recognized a $64 million foreign currency loss as a result of the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiary. This decrease in non-operating income, net was partially offset\\nby an increase in other income, net during fiscal 2013, which was primarily due to gains from our marketable securities that we designated as trading that were held to support our deferred compensation plan obligations. \\nProvision for Income Taxes:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our effective tax rate in all periods is the result of the mix of income earned in\\nvarious tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates. The provision for income taxes differs from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to earnings considered as indefinitely reinvested in\\nforeign operations, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit and the U.S. domestic production activity deduction. Future effective tax rates could be adversely affected if earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we\\nhave lower statutory tax rates, by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations or by adverse rulings in tax related litigation.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nYear Ended May\\xa031,\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nPercent Change\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nPercent Change\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n (Dollars in millions)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2014\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nActual\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nConstant\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2013\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nActual\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nConstant\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2012\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Provision for income taxes\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02,749\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n-7%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n-6%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02,973\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n0%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n3%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02,981\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Effective tax rate\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n20.1%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n21.4%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n23.0%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Provision for income taxes in fiscal 2014\\ndecreased, relative to the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2013, due to a tax favorable change in the jurisdictional mix of our earnings and the effects of acquisition related settlements with tax authorities during fiscal 2014. \\nFiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Provision for income taxes in fiscal 2013 decreased slightly due\\nto acquisition related items, the retroactive extension of the U.S. research and development credit, offset by higher income before provision for income taxes.

These working capital increases were partially offset by the reclassification of $1.5 billion of senior notes due July 2014 from long-term to current, cash used for repurchases of our\\ncommon stock (we used $9.8 billion of cash for common stock repurchases during fiscal 2014), cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders, and cash used for acquisitions, all of which occurred during fiscal 2014. Our working capital\\n\\n \\xa0 66 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nmay be impacted by some of the aforementioned factors in future periods, the amounts and timing of which are variable.  The increase in working capital as of May\\xa031, 2013 in comparison to May\\xa031, 2012 was primarily due to our issuance of $5.0 billion of senior notes in October 2012, the favorable impact to our\\nnet current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal 2013, and, to a lesser extent, cash proceeds from stock option exercises. This increase was partially offset by cash used for repurchases of our common stock (we used $11.0 billion of\\ncash for common stock repurchases during fiscal 2013), cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders, and cash used for acquisitions. \\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at\\nmajor banks, Tier-1 commercial paper and other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities primarily consist of time deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper, corporate notes, and certain other\\nsecurities. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May\\xa031, 2014 in comparison to May\\xa031, 2013 was due to an increase in cash generated from our operating activities, our issuance of \\x802.0 billion and $3.0\\nbillion of senior notes in July 2013, and to a lesser extent, cash proceeds from stock option exercises. These increases were partially offset by $9.8 billion of repurchases of our common stock, $3.5 billion of net cash paid for acquisitions and\\n$2.2 billion used for the payment of cash dividends to our stockholders. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities included $35.2 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries as of May\\xa031, 2014. We consider $32.4 billion of our undistributed\\nearnings as indefinitely reinvested in our foreign operations outside the United States. These undistributed earnings would be subject to U.S. income tax if repatriated to the United States. Assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits,\\nthe potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings would be approximately $10.0 billion as of May\\xa031, 2014 should the amounts be repatriated to the United States. The amount of cash, cash equivalents and\\nmarketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective\\nreporting period (the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere\\nin this Annual Report). As the U.S.\\xa0Dollar modestly strengthened against certain major international currencies during fiscal 2014, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for these\\nsubsidiaries decreased on a net basis as of May\\xa031, 2014 relative to what we would have reported using constant currency rates from our May\\xa031, 2013 balance sheet date.  The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May\\xa031, 2013 in comparison to May\\xa031, 2012 was due to an increase in cash generated from our operating activities, our\\nissuance of $5.0 billion of senior notes in October 2012, and to a lesser extent, cash proceeds from fiscal 2013 stock option exercises. This increase was partially offset by $11.0 billion of repurchases of our common stock, $3.3 billion of net cash\\npaid for acquisitions, the repayments of $1.7 billion of short-term borrowings pursuant to our expired revolving credit facilities, the repayment of $1.25 billion of senior notes which matured in April 2013, and the payment of cash dividends to our\\nstockholders. Additionally, our reported cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of May\\xa031, 2013 decreased in comparison to May\\xa031, 2012 due to the general strengthening of the U.S.\\xa0Dollar in comparison to certain\\nmajor international currencies during fiscal 2013.  Days sales outstanding, which was calculated by dividing period end accounts receivable by\\naverage daily sales for the quarter, was 48 days at May\\xa031, 2014 compared with 50 days at May\\xa031, 2013. The days sales outstanding calculation excluded the impact of revenue adjustments resulting from business combinations that reduced our\\nacquired cloud SaaS and PaaS obligations, software license updates and product support obligations and hardware systems support obligations to fair value.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nYear Ended May\\xa031,\\n\\xa0\\n\\n (Dollars in millions)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2014\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nChange\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2013\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nChange\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2012\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Net cash provided by operating activities\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n14,921\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n5%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n14,224\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n3%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n13,743\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Net cash used for investing activities\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(7,539\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n27%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(5,956\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n-29%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(8,381\\n)\\xa0\\n\\n Net cash used for financing activities\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n(4,068\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n-52%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n(8,500\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n39%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n(6,099\\n)\\xa0\\n\\n \\xa0 67 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Cash flows from operating activities:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our largest source of operating\\ncash flows is cash collections from our customers following the purchase and renewal of their software license updates and product support agreements. Payments from customers for these support agreements are generally received near the beginning of\\nthe contracts\\x92 terms, which are generally one year in length. We also generate significant cash from new software licenses sales and sales of hardware systems support arrangements, and to a lesser extent, sales of services, hardware systems\\nproducts, and cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee related expenditures, material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware systems products, taxes and leased\\nfacilities.  Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Net cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal\\n2014 in comparison to fiscal 2013 primarily due to the following: the fiscal 2013 non-recurring impacts of a reduction of contingent consideration payable in connection with an acquisition of $387 million (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated\\nFinancial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information) and the impact of a $306 million non-current receivable related to certain litigation (see Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included\\nelsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information), both of which increased our net income in fiscal 2013 without the corresponding cash flow benefits. These items did not recur during fiscal 2014. \\nFiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Net cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal 2013 in comparison to\\nfiscal 2012 primarily due to cash favorable impacts of increased net income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation and depreciation during fiscal 2013 in comparison to fiscal 2012. \\nCash flows from investing activities:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to\\nacquisitions and the timing of purchases, maturities and sales of our investments in marketable debt securities. We also use cash to invest in capital and other assets, including certain intangible assets, to support our growth. \\nFiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Net cash used for investing activities increased in fiscal 2014 due to an increase in\\nnet cash used to purchase marketable securities (net of proceeds received from sales and maturities) and an increase in cash used for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, in each case during fiscal 2014 in comparison to fiscal 2013. \\nFiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Net cash used for investing activities decreased in fiscal 2013 primarily due to a\\ndecrease in net cash used to purchase marketable securities (net of proceeds received from sales and maturities) and a decrease in cash used for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, in each case during fiscal 2013 in comparison to fiscal 2012.\\n Cash flows from financing activities:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily\\nrelate to borrowings and repayments related to our debt instruments as well as stock repurchases, dividend payments and proceeds from stock option exercises.  Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Net cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2014 decreased in comparison to fiscal 2013 primarily due to the repayment of $3.0\\nbillion of borrowings pursuant to senior notes maturities and certain expired revolving credit facilities in fiscal 2013 (no repayments during fiscal 2014), a net increase in borrowings during fiscal 2014 (we issued \\x802.0 billion and $3.0\\nbillion of senior notes during fiscal 2014 in comparison to $5.0 billion of senior notes issued during fiscal 2013), lower stock repurchase activity during fiscal 2014 and higher proceeds from stock option exercises during fiscal 2014. These fiscal\\n2014 cash favorable variances were partially offset by an increase in payments of cash dividends to stockholders in fiscal 2014 in comparison to fiscal 2013.  Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Net cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2013 increased in comparison to fiscal 2012 primarily due to an increase in our common\\nstock repurchases (we used $11.0 billion of cash for common stock repurchases during fiscal 2013 in comparison to $5.9 billion in fiscal 2012) and an increase in repayments of borrowings (we repaid $3.0 billion of borrowings pursuant to senior notes\\nmaturities and certain expired revolving credit facilities in fiscal 2013 in comparison to the repayments of $1.4 billion of short-term borrowings from expired revolving credit facilities, and legacy convertible notes assumed from RightNow in fiscal\\n2012), partially offset by our issuance of $5.0 billion of senior notes in October 2012, an increase in proceeds from stock option exercises and certain other financing activity cash flow increases, net. \\n \\xa0 68 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Free cash flow:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on\\na GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to analyze cash flows generated from our operations. We believe free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors.\\nThe presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.

Long-Term Customer Financing:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We offer certain of our\\ncustomers the option to acquire our software products, hardware systems products and services offerings through separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis\\nto financial institutions within 90 days of the contracts\\x92 dates of execution. We record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financial assets because we are considered to have surrendered control of\\nthese financial assets. We financed $1.6 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, or approximately 17%, 19% and 17%, respectively, of our new software licenses revenues in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, and $168 million, $161 million and\\n$134 million, respectively, or approximately 6%, 5%, and 3%, respectively, of our hardware systems products revenues in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012.  Recent Financing Activities:  Senior Notes:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0As of\\nMay\\xa031, 2014, we had $24.2 billion of senior notes outstanding ($18.5 billion outstanding as of May\\xa031, 2013). In July 2013, we issued \\x802.0 billion ($2.7 billion as of May\\xa031, 2014) of fixed rate senior notes comprised of\\n\\x801.25 billion of 2.25% notes due January 2021 (2021 Notes) and \\x80750\\xa0million of 3.125% notes due July 2025 (2025 Notes, and together with the 2021 Notes, the Euro Notes). The Euro Notes are registered and trade on the New York Stock\\nExchange. We are accounting for the 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholders\\x92 equity\\ncaused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the U.S.\\xa0Dollar pursuant to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815).  In July 2013, we also issued $3.0 billion of senior notes comprised of $500 million of floating rate notes due January 2019 (2019 Floating Rate Notes), $1.5 billion of 2.375% notes due January 2019 (2019\\nNotes) and $1.0\\xa0billion of 3.625% notes due July 2023 (2023 Notes, and together with the Floating Rate Notes and 2019 Notes, the U.S.\\xa0Dollar Notes).  We issued the Euro Notes and the U.S.\\xa0Dollar Notes for general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and future acquisitions.\\nAdditional details regarding the Euro Notes, the U.S.\\xa0Dollar Notes, and the related hedge accounting are included in Note 8 and Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report. \\nInterest Rate Swap Agreements:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In July 2013, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic\\neffect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with our 2019 Notes so that the interest payable on these notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. As of May\\xa031, 2014, our 2019 Notes had an effective interest rate of 0.88%\\nafter considering the effects of the aforementioned interest rate swap arrangements. We are accounting for these interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC\\xa0815. Additional details regarding our senior notes and related\\ninterest rate swap agreements are included in Note 8 and Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report. \\n \\xa0 69 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Cross Currency Swap Agreements:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In July 2013, in connection with the issuance\\nof the 2021 Notes, we entered into certain cross-currency swap agreements to manage the related foreign currency exchange risk by effectively converting the fixed-rate, Euro denominated 2021 Notes, including the annual interest payments and the\\npayment of principal at maturity, to fixed-rate, U.S.\\xa0Dollar denominated debt. The economic effect of the swap agreements was to eliminate the uncertainty of the cash flows in U.S. Dollars associated with the 2021 Notes by fixing the principal\\namount of the 2021 Notes at $1.6 billion with an annual interest rate of 3.53%. We have designated these cross-currency swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for these as cash flow hedges pursuant to ASC 815.\\nAdditional details regarding our senior notes and related cross-currency swap agreements are included in Note 8 and Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report. \\nCash Dividends:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In fiscal 2014, we declared and paid cash dividends of $0.48 per share that totaled $2.2\\xa0billion. In\\nJune 2014, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per share of outstanding common stock payable on July\\xa030, 2014 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July\\xa09, 2014. Future declarations of\\ndividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.  Common\\nStock Repurchases:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On June\\xa020, 2013, we announced that our Board of Directors approved an expansion of our stock\\nrepurchase program by an additional $12.0 billion. As of May\\xa031, 2014, approximately $4.3 billion remained available for stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program. We repurchased 280.4\\xa0million shares for $9.8 billion,\\n346.1\\xa0million shares for $11.0 billion, and 207.3\\xa0million shares for $6.0 billion in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will\\ndepend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations (described further below), our stock price and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases\\nmay be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time. \\nContractual Obligations:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future\\npayments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from these estimates. We cannot provide certainty\\nregarding the timing and amounts of payments. We have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in preparing this information within the context of our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\\nThe following is a summary of certain of our contractual obligations as of May\\xa031, 2014: \\n \\xa0 70 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of

agreements related to our 3.75% senior notes due July 2014\\n(2014 Notes) and our 2019 Notes that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with these senior notes so that the interest obligations effectively became variable pursuant to a LIBOR-based index. Interest\\npayments on the 2014 Notes and 2019 Notes presented in the contractual obligations table above have been estimated using interest rates of 1.29% and 0.88%, respectively, which represented our effective interest rates for these senior notes as of\\nMay\\xa031, 2014 after consideration of these fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements, and are subject to change in future periods. The changes in fair values of our debt associated with the interest rate risks that we are hedging pursuant\\nto these agreements were included in notes payable and other current borrowings for the 2014 Notes and notes payable and other non-current borrowings for the 2019 Notes in our consolidated balance sheet and have been included in the above table of\\ntotal borrowings as of May\\xa031, 2014.  Our floating rate senior notes due January 2019 bore interest at a rate of 0.81% as\\nof May\\xa031, 2014 and interest payments on these notes presented in the contractual obligations table above have been estimated using this rate.  The 2021 Notes and the 2025 Notes are denominated in Euro. In connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes, we entered into certain cross-currency swap agreements that have the economic effect of\\nconverting our fixed rate, Euro denominated debt, including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a fixed rate, U.S.\\xa0Dollar denominated debt of $1.6 billion with a fixed annual interest rate of 3.53%. Principal\\nand interest payments for the 2021 Notes presented in the contractual obligations table above were calculated based on the terms of the aforementioned cross-currency swap agreements. Principal and interest payments for the 2025 Notes presented in\\nthe contractual obligations table above were estimated using foreign currency exchange rates as of May\\xa031, 2014.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n(2)\\xa0\\n Primarily represents leases of facilities and includes future minimum rent payments for facilities that we have vacated pursuant to our restructuring\\nand merger integration activities. We have approximately $112 million in facility obligations, net of estimated sublease income, for certain vacated locations in accrued restructuring in our consolidated balance sheet at May\\xa031, 2014.   \\xa0\\n\\n\\n(3)\\xa0\\n Primarily represents amounts associated with agreements that are enforceable, legally binding and specify terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities\\nto be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payment. We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for our hardware products and to perform final assembly and testing of\\nfinished hardware products. We also obtain individual hardware components for our products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and\\nmanufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead-times and/or commercially standard lead-times for the particular part or product and have been included in the amount presented in the above contractual\\nobligations table. Routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to our external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in the ordinary course of business are not included in the amounts\\npresented above as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way. \\n \\xa0 71 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n On June\\xa022, 2014, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement) with MICROS\\nSystems, Inc. (MICROS), a provider of integrated software, hardware and services solutions to the hospitality and retail industries. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we will commence a tender offer for the outstanding shares and shares generally\\nrepresenting vested equity incentive awards of MICROS (collectively, MICROS Shares). MICROS shareholders will have the right to tender their MICROS Shares to Oracle in exchange for $68.00 per share in cash upon consummation of the tender offer. The\\ntender offer will commence no later than ten business days from June 22, 2014. After completion of the tender offer and subject to certain limited conditions, MICROS will merge with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oracle. In addition, unvested\\nequity awards to acquire MICROS common stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the conclusion of the merger will generally be converted into equity awards denominated in shares of our common stock based on formulas contained in the Merger\\nAgreement. The estimated total purchase price for MICROS is approximately $5.3\\xa0billion. This transaction is conditioned upon (i)\\xa0at least a majority of the MICROS Shares being validly tendered to Oracle, (ii)\\xa0regulatory clearance\\nunder the\\xa0Hart-Scott-Rodino\\xa0Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, (iii)\\xa0the applicable merger control laws of the European Commission and other jurisdictions, and (iv)\\xa0certain other customary closing conditions. We also have\\nentered into certain other agreements to acquire other companies and expect these proposed acquisitions to close during the first quarter of fiscal 2015. We intend to finance our proposed acquisitions through a combination of our internally\\navailable cash, our cash generated from operations, our existing available debt capacity, additional borrowings, or from the issuance of additional securities.  As of May\\xa031, 2014, we had $4.5 billion of gross unrecognized income tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and all such obligations have\\nbeen excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty as to when they might be settled. We cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which the remainder of our unrecognized income tax benefits will be settled or released with\\nthe relevant tax authorities, although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal 2015.  We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures and contractual\\nobligation requirements. In addition, we believe we could fund any future acquisitions, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from\\noperations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities.  Off-Balance Sheet\\nArrangements:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses,\\nresults of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.  Selected Quarterly Financial\\nData  Quarterly revenues, expenses and operating income have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including sales\\nforce incentive compensation plans. In addition, our European operations generally provide lower revenues in our first fiscal quarter because of the reduced economic activity in Europe during the summer. These seasonal factors are common in the high\\ntechnology industry. These factors have caused a decrease in our first quarter revenues as compared to revenues in the immediately preceding fourth quarter, which historically has been our highest revenue quarter within a particular fiscal year.\\nSimilarly, the operating income of our business is affected by seasonal factors in a consistent manner as our revenues (in particular, our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions segment) as certain expenses within our cost structure\\nare relatively fixed in the short-term.

We historically have granted only stock options to our employees and any restricted stock-based awards outstanding were assumed as a result of our acquisitions.  We recognize that stock options and restricted stock-based awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of stock options and restricted stock-based awards granted while\\nproviding competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June\\xa01, 2011 has been a weighted average annualized rate of 2.3%\\xa0per year. The potential dilution percentage is\\ncalculated as the average annualized new stock options or restricted stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of stock options and restricted stock-based awards forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by the weighted average\\noutstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all stock options are exercised and restricted stock-based awards vest. Of the outstanding stock options at May\\xa031, 2014, which generally have\\na 10-year exercise period, less than 1.0% have exercise prices higher than the current market price of our common stock. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock-based compensation program;\\nhowever, we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes. At May\\xa031, 2014, the maximum potential\\ndilution from all outstanding and unexercised stock options and restricted stock-based awards, regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including stock options where the strike price is higher than the current\\nmarket price, was 10.4%. \\n \\xa0 73 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviews and approves the organization-wide stock option\\ngrants to selected employees, all stock option grants to executive officers and any individual stock option grants in excess of 100,000 shares. A separate Plan Committee, which is an executive officer committee, approves individual stock option\\ngrants of up to 100,000 shares to non-executive officers and employees.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  For information with respect to recent accounting\\npronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. \\nItem\\xa07A. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk \\nCash, Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities and Interest Income Risk  Our bank deposits and time deposits are generally held with large, diverse financial institutions worldwide with high investment grade credit ratings, which we believe mitigates certain risks. In\\naddition, we purchase high quality debt security investments, approximately 45% of which have maturity dates within one year and 55% of which have maturity dates within one to four years as of May\\xa031, 2014 (see a description of our debt\\nsecurities held in Note 3 and Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report and \\x93Liquidity and Capital Resources\\x94 above). Interest rate movements can impact the valuation of our debt\\nsecurities but are presently not significant to our valuations considering the current interest rate environment and the duration of our portfolio. Substantially all of our marketable securities are designated as available-for-sale. We generally do\\nnot use our investments for trading purposes.  Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from\\nour cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. For fiscal 2014, total interest income was $263 million with our cash, cash \\n \\xa0 74 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nequivalents and marketable investments yielding an average 0.79% on a worldwide basis.

In July 2013, we issued \\x802.0\\nbillion ($2.7 billion as of May\\xa031, 2014) of fixed rate senior notes and $3.0\\xa0billion of senior notes comprised of $500 million of floating rate notes and $2.5 billion of fixed rate notes as described in the \\x93Recent Financing\\nActivities\\x94 section of Management\\x92s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 7) in this Annual Report. In July 2013, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with our $1.5 billion of 2.375% senior notes due\\nJanuary 2019 (2019 Notes) so that the interest payable on the 2019 Notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. In September 2009, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed\\ninterest obligations associated with our $1.5 billion of 3.75% senior notes due July 2014 (2014 Notes) so that the interest payable on the 2014 Notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. The critical terms of the interest rate swap agreements\\nand the 2019 Notes and 2014 Notes that the interest rate swap agreements pertain to match, including the notional amounts and maturity dates. We do not use these interest rate swap arrangements or our fixed rate borrowings for trading purposes. We\\nare accounting for these interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Additional details regarding our senior notes and related interest rate swap agreements are included in Note 8 and Note\\n11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report.  By entering into these interest rate swap\\narrangements, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon LIBOR.\\xa0As of May\\xa031, 2014, our 2014 Notes and 2019 Notes had effective interest rates of 1.29% and 0.88%, respectively, after considering the effects of\\nthe aforementioned interest rate swap arrangements. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations.\\xa0An interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure\\ninterest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest rates.\\xa0As of May\\xa031, 2014, if\\xa0LIBOR-based interest rates increased by 100 basis points, the change would increase our\\ninterest expense annually by approximately $22 million as it relates to our fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements and floating rate borrowings.  Currency Risk  Foreign Currency Transaction and Translation Risks\\x97Foreign\\nCurrency Borrowings and Related Hedges  In July 2013, we issued \\x801.25 billion of 2.25% notes due January 2021 (2021 Notes) and we\\nentered into certain cross-currency swap agreements to manage the related foreign exchange risk by effectively converting the fixed-rate Euro denominated debt, including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a\\nfixed-rate, U.S.\\xa0Dollar denominated debt. The economic effect of the swap agreements was to eliminate the uncertainty of the cash flows in U.S. Dollars associated with the 2021 Notes by fixing the principal amount of the 2021 Notes at $1.6\\nbillion with an annual interest rate of 3.53%. \\n \\xa0 75 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n In July 2013, we also issued \\x80750\\xa0million of 3.125% notes due July 2025 (2025 Notes). We\\ndesignated the 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholders\\x92 equity caused by the changes\\nin foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the U.S. Dollar. As a result, the change in the carrying value of the Euro denominated 2025 Notes due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on the effective portion is\\nrecorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report and totaled $34 million of net\\nother comprehensive losses for fiscal 2014. Any remaining change in the carrying value of the 2025 Notes representing the ineffective portion of the net investment hedge is recognized in non-operating (expense) income, net. We did not record any\\nineffectiveness during fiscal 2014.  Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the Euro and the U.S.\\xa0Dollar will impact the amount of\\nU.S. Dollars that we will require to settle the 2025 Notes at maturity. If the U.S.\\xa0Dollar weakened by 10% in comparison to the Euro as of May\\xa031, 2014, our obligation to settle the 2025 Notes in U.S. Dollars would have increased by\\napproximately $102 million.  Foreign Currency Transaction Risk\\x97Foreign Currency Forward Contracts \\nWe transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the\\nrisks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or\\nlosses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions. We may suspend this program from time to time. Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from\\nintercompany sublicense fees, intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration.  We neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815. Accordingly, we record the fair values\\nof these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statement of operations. Given the short duration of the forward contracts, the amount recorded is\\nnot significant. The balance sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is prepaid expenses and other current assets for a net unrealized gain position and other current liabilities for a net unrealized loss position. The\\nstatement of operations classification for changes in fair values of these forward contracts is non-operating (expense) income, net for both realized and unrealized gains and losses.  We expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts. Our ultimate realized gain or\\nloss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized\\ngain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors. As of May\\xa031, 2014 and 2013, the notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $3.6\\nbillion and $3.0 billion, respectively. As of May\\xa031, 2014 and 2013, the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $2.0 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively.\\nThe fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal at May\\xa031, 2014 and 2013. Net foreign exchange transaction losses included in non-operating (expense) income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of\\noperations were $375\\xa0million, $162 million and $105 million in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Included in the net foreign exchange transaction losses for fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 were foreign currency losses relating to our\\nVenezuelan subsidiary\\x92s operations, which are more thoroughly described under \\x93Non-Operating (Expense) Income, net\\x94 in Management\\x92s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations above. As a large\\nportion of our consolidated operations are international, we could experience additional foreign currency volatility in the future, the amounts and timing of which are unknown. \\n \\xa0 76 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n Foreign Currency Translation Risk\\x97Impact on Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\\n Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon\\nthe translation of these amounts into U.S. Dollars. In particular, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by these subsidiaries is subject to\\ntranslation variance caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and is also\\npresented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report).  As the\\nU.S.\\xa0Dollar fluctuated against certain international currencies as of the end of fiscal 2014, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for foreign subsidiaries that hold international\\ncurrencies as of May\\xa031, 2014 decreased relative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate as of May\\xa031, 2013. As reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, the estimated effect of exchange rate changes on\\nour reported cash and cash equivalents balances in U.S. Dollars for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 were decreases of $158 million, $110 million and $471 million, respectively.

Disclosure controls are procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act,\\nsuch as this Annual Report on Form 10-K, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Disclosure controls are also designed to ensure that such information is\\naccumulated and communicated to our \\n \\xa0 77 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nmanagement, including our Chief Executive Officer and President and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our quarterly evaluation of\\ndisclosure controls includes an evaluation of some components of our internal control over financial reporting. We also perform a separate annual evaluation of internal control over financial reporting for the purpose of providing the management\\nreport below.  The evaluation of our disclosure controls included a review of their objectives and design, our implementation of the controls\\nand the effect of the controls on the information generated for use in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the course of the controls evaluation, we reviewed data errors or control problems identified and\\nsought to confirm that appropriate corrective actions, including process improvements, were being undertaken. This type of evaluation is performed on a quarterly basis so that the conclusions of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and\\nPresident and Chief Financial Officer, concerning the effectiveness of the disclosure controls can be reported in our periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K. Many of the components of our disclosure controls are also evaluated on an ongoing\\nbasis by both our internal audit and finance organizations. The overall goals of these various evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and to modify them as necessary. We intend to maintain our disclosure controls as dynamic\\nprocesses and procedures that we adjust as circumstances merit.  Based on our management\\x92s evaluation (with the participation of our Chief\\nExecutive Officer and our President and Chief Financial Officer), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our Chief Executive Officer and our President and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and\\nprocedures were effective.  Management\\x92s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act\\nRules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and President and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting as of May\\xa031, 2014 based on the guidelines established in Internal Control\\x97Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\\x92s 1992 framework.\\nOur internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in\\naccordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our\\ninternal control over financial reporting was effective as of May\\xa031, 2014. We reviewed the results of management\\x92s assessment with our Finance and Audit Committee.  The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May\\xa031, 2014 has been audited by Ernst\\xa0& Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in\\ntheir report which is included in Part IV, Item\\xa015 of this Annual Report.  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\n There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by\\nparagraph (d)\\xa0of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls  Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and President and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are\\ndesigned to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial\\nreporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control\\nsystem must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation\\n\\n \\xa0 78 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n \\nof controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision\\nmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls.\\nThe design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions;\\nover time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system, misstatements due to error\\nor fraud may occur and not be detected.

Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item\\xa015(a) 2. These\\nfinancial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company\\x92s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. \\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we\\nplan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial\\nstatements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for\\nour opinion.  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial\\nposition of Oracle Corporation at May\\xa031, 2014 and 2013, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May\\xa031, 2014, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting\\nprinciples. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein. \\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Oracle Corporation\\x92s\\ninternal control over financial reporting as of May\\xa031, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) and our report\\ndated June\\xa026, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.  /s/ ERNST\\xa0& YOUNG LLP \\nSan Jose, California  June\\xa026, 2014\\n\\n \\xa0 82 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n REPORT OF ERNST\\xa0& YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\\n The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Oracle Corporation  We have audited Oracle Corporation\\x92s internal control over financial reporting as of May\\xa031, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control\\x97Integrated Framework issued by the\\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) (the COSO criteria). Oracle Corporation\\x92s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of\\nthe effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management\\x92s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company\\x92s internal control\\nover financial reporting based on our audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting\\nOversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included\\nobtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing\\nsuch other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \\nA company\\x92s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial\\nreporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\\x92s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that\\n(1)\\xa0pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)\\xa0provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as\\nnecessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors\\nof the company; and (3)\\xa0provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\\x92s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\n Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of\\nany evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \\nIn our opinion, Oracle Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May\\xa031, 2014,\\nbased on the COSO criteria.  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\\nStates), the consolidated balance sheets of Oracle Corporation as of May\\xa031, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended\\nMay\\xa031, 2014 of Oracle Corporation and our report dated June\\xa026, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.  /s/\\nERNST\\xa0& YOUNG LLP  San Jose, California  June\\xa026, 2014 \\n \\xa0 83 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of

develops, manufactures, markets, hosts and supports database and middleware software, application software, cloud\\ninfrastructure, hardware systems\\x97including computer server, storage and networking products\\x97and related services that are engineered to work together in cloud-based and on-premise information technology (IT) environments. We offer our\\ncustomers the option to purchase our software and hardware systems products and related services to manage their own cloud-based or on-premise IT environments, or to deploy our Oracle Cloud offerings, which are a comprehensive set of cloud service\\nofferings including cloud software-as-a-service (SaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) that we manage, host and support. Customers that purchase our software products may elect to purchase software license\\nupdates and product support contracts, which provide our customers with rights to unspecified product upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period as well as technical support assistance. Customers that purchase our hardware\\nproducts may elect to purchase hardware systems support contracts, which provide customers with software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our server, storage and networking products, such as Oracle Solaris\\nand certain other software products, and can include product repairs, maintenance services, and technical support services. We also offer customers a broad set of services offerings including consulting services, advanced customer support services\\nand education services.  Oracle Corporation conducts business globally and was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the\\nsuccessor to operations originally begun in June 1977.  Basis of Financial Statements \\nThe consolidated financial statements included our accounts and the accounts of our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. Noncontrolling interest\\npositions of certain of our consolidated entities are reported as a separate component of consolidated equity from the equity attributable to Oracle\\x92s stockholders for all periods presented. The noncontrolling interests in our net income were\\nnot significant to our consolidated results for the periods presented and therefore have been included as a component of non-operating (expense) income, net in our consolidated statements of operations. Intercompany transactions and balances have\\nbeen eliminated.  We have reclassified certain revenues and expenses to conform to the current period\\x92s presentation for all periods\\npresented in our consolidated statements of operations. All such reclassifications did not affect our consolidated total revenues, consolidated operating income or consolidated net income.  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we added an operating segment, cloud infrastructure-as-a-service, as a result of a reorganization of financial information presented to our chief operating\\ndecision maker for operational decision and resource allocation purposes. We concluded this operating segment is a reporting unit for goodwill allocation and impairment assessment purposes.  Acquisition related and other expenses as presented in our consolidated statement of operations for fiscal 2013 included a change in fair value of contingent consideration payable, which resulted in a net\\nbenefit of $387 million in fiscal 2013 (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements below), and a $306 million benefit that we recorded in fiscal 2013 related to certain litigation (see Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial\\nStatements below).  Use of Estimates  Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board\\x92s (FASB) Accounting\\nStandards Codification (ASC) and consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments\\nand assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and\\n\\n \\xa0 89 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May\\xa031, 2014  \\xa0\\n \\nassumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported\\namounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our consolidated financial statements will be affected. In many cases, the\\naccounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management\\x92s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management\\x92s judgment in selecting among available alternatives\\nwould not produce a materially different result.  Revenue Recognition  Our sources of revenues include: (1)\\xa0software and cloud revenues, including new software licenses revenues earned from granting licenses to use our software products; cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues\\ngenerated from fees for granting customers access to a broad range of our software and related support offerings on a subscription basis in a secure, standards-based cloud computing environment; cloud IaaS revenues generated from fees for deployment\\nand management offerings for our software and hardware and related IT infrastructure generally on a subscription basis; and software license updates and product support revenues; (2)\\xa0hardware systems revenues, which include the sale of hardware\\nsystems products including computer servers, storage products, networking and data center fabric products, and hardware systems support revenues; and (3)\\xa0services, which includes software and hardware related services including consulting,\\nadvanced customer support and education revenues. Revenues generally are recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.  Revenue Recognition for Software Products and Software Related Services (Software Elements)  New software licenses revenues primarily represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database, middleware and application software and exclude cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues and\\nrevenues derived from software license updates, which are included in software license updates and product support revenues. The basis for our new software licenses revenue recognition is substantially governed by the accounting guidance contained\\nin ASC 985-605, Software-Revenue Recognition. We exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software and software related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period. \\nFor software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software, we recognize new software\\nlicenses revenues when: (1)\\xa0we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software; (2)\\xa0we deliver the products; (3)\\xa0the sale price is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant\\nuncertainties; and (4)\\xa0collection is probable. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met, are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met. \\nSubstantially all of our software license arrangements do not include acceptance provisions. However, if acceptance provisions exist as part of public\\npolicy, for example, in agreements with government entities where acceptance periods are required by law, or within previously executed terms and conditions that are referenced in the current agreement and are short-term in nature, we generally\\nrecognize revenues upon delivery provided the acceptance terms are perfunctory and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. If acceptance provisions are not perfunctory (for example, acceptance provisions that are long-term in nature or\\nare not included as standard terms of an arrangement), revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period.  The vast majority of our software license arrangements include software license updates and product support contracts, which are entered into at the customer\\x92s option and are recognized ratably over\\nthe term of the arrangement, typically one year. Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period. Product\\n\\n \\xa0 90 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May\\xa031, 2014  \\xa0\\n \\nsupport includes internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel. Software license updates and product support contracts are\\ngenerally priced as a percentage of the net new software licenses fees. Substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually.  Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements\\x97Software Products and Software Related Services (Software Arrangements)  We often enter into arrangements with customers that purchase both software related products and software related services from us at the same time, or within close proximity of one another (referred to\\nas software related multiple-element arrangements). Such software related multiple-element arrangements include the sale of our software products, software license updates and product support contracts and other software related services whereby\\nsoftware license delivery is followed by the subsequent or contemporaneous delivery of the other elements. For those software related multiple-element arrangements, we have applied the residual method to determine the amount of new software license\\nrevenues to be recognized pursuant to ASC 985-605. Under the residual method, if fair value exists for undelivered elements in a multiple-element arrangement, such fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred with the remaining portion of the\\narrangement consideration generally recognized upon delivery of the software license. We allocate the fair value of each element of a software related multiple-element arrangement based upon its fair value as determined by our vendor specific\\nobjective evidence (VSOE\\x97described further below), with any remaining amount allocated to the software license.  Revenue\\nRecognition for Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS Offerings, Hardware Systems Products, Hardware Systems Support and Related Services (Nonsoftware Elements)  Our revenue recognition policy for nonsoftware deliverables including cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, hardware systems products and hardware systems related services is based upon the accounting\\nguidance contained in ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition, Multiple-Element Arrangements, and we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues, hardware systems\\nproducts revenues and hardware related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period.  Revenues from the sales of our\\nnonsoftware elements are recognized when: (1)\\xa0persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2)\\xa0we deliver the products and passage of the title to the buyer occurs; (3)\\xa0the sale price is fixed or determinable; and (4)\\xa0collection\\nis reasonably assured. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met. When applicable, we reduce revenues for estimated returns or certain\\nother incentive programs where we have the ability to sufficiently estimate the effects of these items. Where an arrangement is subject to acceptance criteria and the acceptance provisions are not perfunctory (for example, acceptance provisions that\\nare long-term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement), revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period. \\nOur cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings generally provide customers access to certain of our software within a cloud-based IT environment that we manage, host\\nand support and offer to customers on a subscription basis. Revenues for our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings are generally recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date the service is made available to customers and all other\\nrevenue recognition criteria have been satisfied.  Our cloud IaaS offerings provide deployment and management offerings for our software and\\nhardware and related IT infrastructure including comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services arrangements for customer IT infrastructure for a stated term that is hosted at our data center facilities, select partner data\\ncenters or physically on-premise at customer facilities generally for a term-based fee; and virtual machine instances that are subscription-based and designed for computing and reliable and secure object storage. Revenues for these cloud IaaS\\nofferings are generally recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date the service is made available to customers and all other revenue recognition criteria have been \\n \\xa0 91 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May\\xa031, 2014  \\xa0\\n \\nsatisfied. Our cloud IaaS offerings also include our Oracle Engineered Systems hardware and related support that are deployed on-premise in our customers\\x92 data centers for a monthly fee and\\nprovide for the purchase of additional capacity on demand. Our revenue recognition policy for these on-premise offerings is in accordance with ASC 605 and ASC 840, Leases, and substantially all of these offerings are accounted for as\\noperating leases as our contracts are structured so that the term of the arrangement is less than 75% of the economic life of the equipment and the present value of the minimum fixed payments are less than 90% of the fair market value of the\\nequipment at the inception of the arrangement. Our evaluation of useful life is based on our historical product development cycles and our historical customer hardware upgrade cycles. Capacity on demand is a contingent payment and is therefore\\nexcluded from our assessment of the net present value of fixed payments. Revenue for capacity on demand is recognized in the period our customers access additional capacity provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. \\nRevenues from the sale of hardware systems products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of computer servers, storage, and networking\\nproducts, including the sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems.  Our hardware systems support offerings generally provide customers with\\nsoftware updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of our server and storage products and can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware systems support contracts are\\ngenerally priced as a percentage of the net hardware systems products fees. Hardware systems support contracts are entered into at the customer\\x92s option and are recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangements, which are\\ntypically one year.  Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements\\x97Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS Offerings, Hardware Systems\\nProducts, Hardware Systems Support and Related Services (Nonsoftware Arrangements)  We enter into arrangements with customers that purchase\\nboth nonsoftware related products and services from us at the same time, or within close proximity of one another (referred to as nonsoftware multiple-element arrangements). Each element within a nonsoftware multiple-element arrangement is accounted\\nfor as a separate unit of accounting provided the following criteria are met: the delivered products or services have value to the customer on a standalone basis; and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the\\ndelivered products or services, delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service is considered probable and is substantially controlled by us. We consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold\\nseparately by us or another vendor or could be resold by the customer. Further, our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products. Where the aforementioned criteria for a separate unit of\\naccounting are not met, the deliverable is combined with the undelivered element(s) and treated as a single unit of accounting for the purposes of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition. For those units of accounting\\nthat include more than one deliverable but are treated as a single unit of accounting, we generally recognize revenues over the delivery period or in the case of our cloud offerings, generally over the estimated customer relationship period. For the\\npurposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we allocate revenue to the respective revenue line items within our consolidated statements of operations based on a rational and consistent\\nmethodology utilizing our best estimate of relative selling prices of such elements.  For our nonsoftware multiple-element arrangements, we\\nallocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangement\\x92s inception. The selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy: VSOE if available, third party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is\\nnot available, or estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE are available (a description as to how we determine VSOE, TPE and ESP is provided below). If a tangible hardware systems product includes software, we determine whether the\\ntangible hardware systems product and the software work together to deliver the product\\x92s essential functionality and, if so, the entire product is treated as a nonsoftware deliverable. The total arrangement consideration is allocated to each\\nseparate unit of accounting for each of the nonsoftware deliverables using the relative selling prices of each \\n \\xa0 92 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May\\xa031, 2014  \\xa0\\n \\nunit based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. We limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional\\nproducts or services or meeting of any specified performance conditions.  When possible, we establish VSOE of selling price for deliverables in\\nsoftware and nonsoftware multiple-element arrangements using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and for software license updates and product support and hardware systems support, based on the renewal rates offered to customers.\\nTPE is established by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated customers. If we are unable to determine the selling price because VSOE or TPE does not exist, we\\ndetermine ESP for the purposes of allocating the arrangement by reviewing historical transactions, including transactions whereby the deliverable was sold on a standalone basis and considering several other external and internal factors including,\\nbut not limited to, pricing practices including discounting, margin objectives, competition, contractually stated prices, the geographies in which we offer our products and services, the type of customer (i.e., distributor, value added reseller,\\ngovernment agency and direct end user, among others) and the stage of the product lifecycle. The determination of ESP is made through consultation with and approval by our management, taking into consideration our pricing model and go-to-market\\nstrategy. As our, or our competitors\\x92, pricing and go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes to our determination of VSOE, TPE and ESP. As a result, our future revenue\\nrecognition for multiple-element arrangements could differ materially from our results in the current period. Selling prices are analyzed on an annual basis or more frequently if we experience significant changes in our selling prices. \\nRevenue Recognition Policies Applicable to both Software and Nonsoftware Elements  Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements\\x97Arrangements with Software and Nonsoftware Elements  We also enter into multiple-element arrangements that may include a combination of our various software related and nonsoftware related products and services offerings including new software licenses,\\nsoftware license updates and product support, cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, hardware systems products, hardware systems support, consulting, advanced customer support services and education. In such arrangements, we first allocate the total\\narrangement consideration based on the relative selling prices of the software group of elements as a whole and to the nonsoftware elements. We then further allocate consideration within the software group to the respective elements within that\\ngroup following the guidance in ASC 985-605 and our policies as described above. After the arrangement consideration has been allocated to the elements, we account for each respective element in the arrangement as described above. \\nOther Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to Software and Nonsoftware Elements  Many of our software arrangements include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts and are included as a part of our services business. Consulting revenues\\nfrom these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from new software licenses revenues because the arrangements qualify as services transactions as defined in ASC 985-605. The more significant factors considered in determining whether\\nthe revenues should be accounted for separately include the nature of services (i.e., consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product), degree of risk, availability of services from other vendors,\\ntiming of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee. Revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed. If there is a significant uncertainty about\\nthe project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services, revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved. We estimate the proportional performance on contracts with fixed or \\x93not to exceed\\x94 fees on a\\nmonthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project. If we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion, revenues are recognized when we receive final\\n\\n \\xa0 93 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May\\xa031, 2014  \\xa0\\n \\nacceptance from the customer that the services have been completed. When total cost estimates exceed revenues, we accrue for the estimated losses immediately using cost estimates that are based\\nupon an average fully burdened daily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the services. The complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of\\nthe proportional performance method of accounting affects the amounts of revenues and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements. A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates, including labor rates,\\nutilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes.  Our advanced customer support services are offered as\\nstandalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying other software and non-software products and services. We offer these advanced support services, both on-premise and remote, to Oracle customers to enable increased performance\\nand higher availability of their products and services. Depending upon the nature of the arrangement, revenues from these services are recognized as the services are performed or ratably over the term of the service period, which is generally one\\nyear or less.  Education revenues are also a part of our services business and include instructor-led, media-based and internet-based training\\nin the use of our software and hardware products. Education revenues are recognized as the classes or other education offerings are delivered. \\nIf an arrangement contains multiple elements and does not qualify for separate accounting for the product and service transactions, then new software\\nlicenses revenues and/or hardware systems products revenues, including the costs of hardware systems products, are generally recognized together with the services based on contract accounting using either the percentage-of-completion or\\ncompleted-contract method. Contract accounting is applied to any bundled software and cloud, hardware systems and services arrangements: (1)\\xa0that include milestones or customer specific acceptance criteria that may affect collection of the\\nsoftware license or hardware systems product fees; (2)\\xa0where consulting services include significant modification or customization of the software or hardware systems product or are of a specialized nature and generally performed only by\\nOracle; (3)\\xa0where significant consulting services are provided for in the software license contract or hardware systems product contract without additional charge or are substantially discounted; or (4)\\xa0where the software license or\\nhardware systems product payment is tied to the performance of consulting services. For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we allocate revenues to software and nonsoftware\\nelements based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of the relative selling price of such elements.  We also\\nevaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing \\x93fiscal funding\\x94 or \\x93termination for convenience\\x94 provisions, when such provisions are required by law, to determine the probability of possible cancellation. We\\nconsider multiple factors, including the history with the customer in similar transactions, the \\x93essential use\\x94 of the software or hardware systems products and the planning, budgeting and approval processes undertaken by the governmental\\nentity. If we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is remote, we then recognize revenues once all of the criteria described above have been met. If such a determination cannot be made, revenues are\\nrecognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity.  We assess whether fees\\nare fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenues if all other revenue recognition requirements are met. Our standard payment terms are net 30 days. However, payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is\\nexecuted. Payments that are due within six months are generally deemed to be fixed or determinable based on our successful collection history on such arrangements, and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition. \\nWhile most of our arrangements for sales within our businesses include short-term payment terms, we have a standard practice of providing long-term\\nfinancing to creditworthy customers primarily through our financing \\n \\xa0 94 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May\\xa031, 2014  \\xa0\\n \\ndivision. Since fiscal 1989, when our financing division was formed, we have established a history of collection, without concessions, on these receivables with payment terms that generally\\nextend up to five years from the contract date. Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, we recognize new software licenses revenues and hardware systems products revenues for these arrangements upon delivery, net of any\\npayment discounts from financing transactions. We have generally sold receivables financed through our financing division on a non-recourse basis to third party financing institutions within 90 days of the contracts\\x92 dates of execution and we\\nclassify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We account for the sales of these receivables as \\x93true sales\\x94 as defined in ASC 860, Transfers and\\nServicing, as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. During fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, $2.0 billion, $2.2 billion and $1.6 billion of our financing receivables were sold to financial institutions,\\nrespectively.  In addition, we enter into arrangements with leasing companies for the sale of our hardware systems products. These leasing\\ncompanies, in turn, lease our products to end-users. The leasing companies generally have no recourse to us in the event of default by the end-user and we recognize revenue upon delivery, if all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.\\n Our customers include several of our suppliers and occasionally, we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendors at\\nor about the same time that we have sold our products to these same companies (Concurrent Transactions). Software license agreements or sales of hardware systems that occur within a three-month time period from the date we have purchased goods or\\nservices from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure. When we acquire goods or services from a customer, we negotiate the purchase separately from any sales transaction, at terms we consider to be at\\narm\\x92s length and settle the purchase in cash. We recognize revenues from Concurrent Transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are met and the goods and services acquired are necessary for our current operations. \\nBusiness Combinations  We apply the\\nprovisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, in the accounting for our acquisitions. It requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of\\nthe acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value\\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to\\none year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired\\nor liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations.  Costs to\\nexit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company or our internal operations are accounted for as one-time termination and exit costs pursuant to ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations, and are accounted for separately from\\nthe business combination. A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred. When estimating\\nthe fair value of facility restructuring activities, assumptions are applied regarding estimated sub-lease payments to be received, which can differ materially from actual results. This may require us to revise our initial estimates which may\\nmaterially affect our results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made.  For a given acquisition, we may\\nidentify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether\\nwe include these contingencies as a part of the fair value \\n \\xa0 95 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May\\xa031, 2014  \\xa0\\n \\nestimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts. If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a pre-acquisition contingency\\n(non-income tax related) by the end of the measurement period, which is generally the case given the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (i)\\xa0it is probable that an asset\\nexisted or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and (ii)\\xa0the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent to the measurement period, changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect\\nearnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position.  In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax\\nrelated valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with\\nany adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance\\x92s or contingency\\x92s estimated value,\\nwhichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations\\nand financial position.  Marketable and Non-Marketable Securities  In accordance with ASC 320, Investments\\x97Debt and Equity Securities, and based on our intentions regarding these instruments, we classify substantially all of our marketable debt and\\nequity securities as available-for-sale. Marketable debt and equity securities are reported at fair value, with all unrealized gains (losses) reflected net of tax in stockholders\\x92 equity on our consolidated balance sheets, and as a line item in\\nour consolidated statements of comprehensive income. If we determine that an investment has an other than temporary decline in fair value, we recognize the investment loss in non-operating (expense) income, net in the accompanying consolidated\\nstatements of operations. We periodically evaluate our investments to determine if impairment charges are required. Substantially all of our marketable debt and equity investments are classified as current based on the nature of the investments and\\ntheir availability for use in current operations.  We hold investments in certain non-marketable equity securities in which we do not have a\\ncontrolling interest or significant influence. These equity securities are recorded at cost and included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. If based on the terms of our ownership of these non-marketable securities, we\\ndetermine that we exercise significant influence on the entity to which these non-marketable securities relate, we apply the requirements of ASC 323, Investments\\x97Equity Method and Joint Ventures, to account for such\\ninvestments. Our non-marketable securities are subject to periodic impairment reviews.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments\\n We apply the provisions of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (ASC 820), to our assets and liabilities that we are required to measure\\nat fair value pursuant to other accounting standards, including our investments in marketable debt and equity securities and our derivative financial instruments.  The additional disclosures regarding our fair value measurements are included in Note 4. \\nAllowances for Doubtful Accounts  We\\nrecord allowances for doubtful accounts based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices. For those invoices not specifically reviewed, provisions are provided at differing rates, based upon the age of the receivable, the\\ncollection history associated with the geographic region that the receivable was recorded in and current economic trends. We write-off a receivable and charge it against its recorded allowance when we have exhausted our collection efforts without\\nsuccess. \\n \\xa0 96 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May\\xa031, 2014  \\xa0\\n Concentrations of Credit Risk  Financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and trade receivables. Our cash and cash\\nequivalents are generally held with large, diverse financial institutions worldwide to reduce the amount of exposure to any single financial institution. Investment policies have been implemented that limit purchases of marketable debt securities to\\ninvestment grade securities. We generally do not require collateral to secure accounts receivable. The risk with respect to trade receivables is mitigated by credit evaluations we perform on our customers, the short duration of our payment terms for\\nthe significant majority of our customer contracts and by the diversification of our customer base. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues in fiscal 2014, 2013 or 2012. \\nInventories  Inventories are stated at\\nthe lower of cost or market value. Cost is computed using standard cost, which approximates actual cost, on a first-in, first-out basis. We evaluate our ending inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence. This evaluation includes\\nanalysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand within specific time horizons (generally six to nine months). Inventories in excess of future demand are written down and charged to hardware systems products expenses. In\\naddition, we assess the impact of changing technology to our inventories and we write down inventories that are considered obsolete. At the point of loss recognition, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes\\nin facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.  Other Receivables\\n Other receivables represent value-added tax and sales tax receivables associated with the sale of our products and services to third\\nparties. Other receivables are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets and totaled $906 million and $826 million at May\\xa031, 2014 and 2013, respectively. \\nDeferred Sales Commissions  We defer\\nsales commission expenses associated with our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, and recognize the related expenses over the non-cancelable term of the related contracts, which are typically one to three years. Amortization of deferred sales\\ncommissions is included as a component of sales and marketing expense in our consolidated statements of operations.  Property, Plant and\\nEquipment  Property, plant and equipment are stated at the lower of cost or realizable value, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation\\nis computed using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from one to fifty years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the lease terms,\\nas appropriate. Property, plant and equipment are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We did not recognize any significant property\\nimpairment charges in fiscal 2014, 2013 or 2012.  Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Impairment Assessments \\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired.\\nIntangible assets that are not considered to have an indefinite useful life are amortized over their useful lives, which generally range from one to ten years. Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible\\nassets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. \\n \\xa0 97 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May\\xa031, 2014  \\xa0\\n The carrying amounts of these assets are periodically reviewed for impairment (at least annually for\\ngoodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets) and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. According to ASC 350, Intangibles\\x97Goodwill and Other, we can opt to\\nperform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting unit\\x92s goodwill for impairment or we can directly perform the two step impairment test. Based on our qualitative assessment, if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more\\nlikely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) to be less than its carrying amount, the two step impairment test will be performed. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair\\nvalue of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting\\nunit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit\\x92s goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit\\x92s\\ngoodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. Recoverability of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash\\nflows the asset is expected to generate. Recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is\\nmeasured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. We did not recognize any goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2014, 2013 or 2012. \\nDerivative Financial Instruments  During\\nfiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, we used derivative and non-derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency and interest rate risks (see Note 11 below for additional information). We account for these instruments in accordance with ASC\\n815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815), which requires that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value as of the reporting date. ASC 815 also requires that changes\\nin our derivatives\\x92 fair values be recognized in earnings, unless specific hedge accounting and documentation criteria are met (i.e., the instruments are accounted for as hedges).  The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For a derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge, the\\ngain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change. The loss or gain attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized in earnings with an offset recorded to the item for which the risk is being hedged. For a derivative instrument\\ndesignated as a cash flow hedge, each reporting period we record the change in fair value on the effective portion to accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets and an amount is reclassified out of accumulated other\\ncomprehensive loss into earnings to offset the earnings impact that is attributable to the risk being hedged. For the non-derivative financial instrument designated as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain of our international\\nsubsidiaries, the change on account of remeasurement of the effective portion for each reporting period is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets.  We perform the effectiveness testing of our aforementioned designated hedges on a quarterly basis and the changes in ineffective portions, if any, are recognized immediately in earnings. \\nLegal Contingencies  We are currently\\ninvolved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination or related to\\nincome taxes, we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. A description of our accounting policies associated with\\ncontingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under \\x93Business Combinations\\x94 above. \\n \\xa0 98 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May\\xa031, 2014  \\xa0\\n Shipping and Handling Costs  Our shipping and handling costs for hardware systems products sales are included in hardware systems products expenses for all periods presented.  Foreign Currency  We transact business in various foreign currencies. In general, the\\nfunctional currency of a foreign operation is the local country\\x92s currency. Consequently, revenues and expenses of operations outside the United States are translated into U.S. Dollars using weighted average exchange rates while assets and\\nliabilities of operations outside the United States are translated into U.S. Dollars using exchange rates at the balance sheet date. The effects of foreign currency translation adjustments are included in stockholders\\x92 equity as a component of\\naccumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and related periodic movements are summarized as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Net foreign exchange transaction losses\\nincluded in non-operating (expense) income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $375 million, $162 million and $105 million in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. \\nStock-Based Compensation  We account for\\nshare-based payments, including grants of employee stock options, restricted stock-based awards and purchases under employee stock purchase plans, in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, which requires that share-based\\npayments (to the extent they are compensatory) be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values and the estimated number of shares we ultimately expect will vest. We recognize stock-based compensation expense on\\na straight-line basis over the service period of the award, which is generally four years.  We record deferred tax assets for stock-based\\ncompensation plan awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns based on the amount of stock-based compensation recognized and the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a tax deduction. \\nAdvertising  All advertising costs are\\nexpensed as incurred. Advertising expenses, which are included within sales and marketing expenses, were $79 million, $85 million and $79 million in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.  Research and Development and Software Development Costs  All research and development costs\\nare expensed as incurred.  Software development costs required to be capitalized under ASC 985-20, Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased or\\nMarketed, and under ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software, were not material to our consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012.  Acquisition Related and Other Expenses  Acquisition related and other expenses consist of\\npersonnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, stock-based compensation expenses, integration related professional services, certain business combination adjustments including adjustments after the measurement period has ended\\nand certain other operating items, net. Stock-based compensation included in acquisition related and other expenses resulted from unvested options and restricted stock-based awards assumed from acquisitions whereby vesting was accelerated\\n\\n \\xa0 99 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May\\xa031, 2014  \\xa0\\n \\nupon termination of the employees pursuant to the original terms of those options and restricted stock-based awards. \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nYear Ended May\\xa031,\\n\\xa0\\n\\n (in millions)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2014\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2013\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2012\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Transitional and other employee related costs\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa027\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa027\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa025\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Stock-based compensation\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n10\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n33\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n33\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Professional fees and other, net\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n20\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(276\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n13\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Business combination adjustments, net\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(16\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(388\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(15\\n)\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Total acquisition related and other expenses\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n41\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n(604\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n56\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n Included in acquisition related and other expenses for fiscal 2013 were changes in estimates for contingent consideration\\npayable, which reduced acquisition related and other expenses by $387 million during fiscal 2013 (see Note 2 for additional information). Acquisition related and other expenses for fiscal 2013 also included a benefit of $306 million related to\\ncertain litigation (see Note 18 for additional information), which reduced our acquisition related and other expenses in this period. \\nNon-Operating (Expense) Income, net \\nNon-operating (expense) income, net consists primarily of interest income, net foreign currency exchange gains (losses), the noncontrolling interests in\\nthe net profits of our majority-owned subsidiaries (Oracle Financial Services Software Limited and Oracle Japan) and net other income (losses), including net realized gains and losses related to all of our investments and net unrealized gains and\\nlosses related to the small portion of our investment portfolio that we classify as trading.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nYear Ended May\\xa031,\\n\\xa0\\n\\n (in millions)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2014\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2013\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2012\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Interest income\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0263\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0237\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0231\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Foreign currency losses, net\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(375\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(162\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(105\\n)\\xa0\\n\\n Noncontrolling interests in income\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(98\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(112\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(119\\n)\\xa0\\n\\n Other income, net\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n69\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n48\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n15\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Total non-operating (expense) income, net\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n(141\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n11\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n22\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n Included in our non-operating (expense) income, net for fiscal 2014 are foreign currency remeasurement losses of $213\\nmillion. These remeasurement losses were related to the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiary. The Venezuelan economy has been determined to be \\x93highly inflationary\\x94 in accordance with ASC 830,\\nForeign Currency Matters. As a result, we report all net monetary assets related to our Venezuelan subsidiary in U.S. Dollars with the associated impacts of periodic changes of Bolivar Fuerte (\\x93VEF\\x94) to U.S.\\xa0Dollar exchange\\nrates in our statements of operations for each respective reporting period. During fiscal 2014, the Venezuelan government issued new exchange agreements that allow for certain foreign currency transactions, which previously were subject to\\nVenezuela\\x92s official Bolivar Fuerte (\\x93VEF\\x94) to U.S.\\xa0Dollar exchange rate (the \\x93Official Rate\\x94), to be subject to conversion at rates established at the Venezuelan government\\x92s auction-based exchange rate programs,\\nthe Complementary System for Foreign Currency Administration (\\x93SICAD\\x94) rates. These SICAD rates were lower than the Official Rate that we had used historically to report the VEF based transactions and net monetary assets of our Venezuelan\\nsubsidiary. To determine which of the various VEF rates to use during fiscal 2014, we evaluated our individual facts and circumstances taking into consideration our legal ability to convert VEF at or to settle VEF based transactions using the SICAD\\nrates, amongst other factors. We concluded that using the SICAD rates was the most \\n \\xa0 100\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May\\xa031, 2014  \\xa0\\n \\nappropriate for our reporting of our Venezuelan subsidiary\\x92s VEF based transactions and net monetary assets in U.S. Dollars, which resulted in the fiscal 2014 remeasurement losses referenced\\nabove. During fiscal 2013, we also incurred a foreign currency remeasurement loss of $64 million related to our Venezuelan subsidiary due to the devaluation of the VEF official exchange rate by the Venezuelan government. Future devaluations of the\\nVenezuelan currency are not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. As a large portion of our consolidated operations are international, we could experience additional foreign currency volatility and incur\\nadditional remeasurement losses in the future, the amounts and timing of which are unknown.  Income Taxes \\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recorded for the expected tax consequences of\\ntemporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts recognized for income tax purposes. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax\\nbenefit that is more likely than not to be realized.  A two-step approach is applied pursuant to ASC 740 in the recognition and measurement of\\nuncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit, including\\nresolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to\\nuncertain tax positions in our provision for income taxes line of our consolidated statements of operations.  A description of our accounting\\npolicies associated with tax related contingencies and valuation allowances assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under \\x93Business Combinations\\x94 above.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  Share-Based Payments with Performance\\nTargets:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In June 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.\\xa02014-12, Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the\\nRequisite Service Period (ASU 2014-12). ASU 2014-12 requires that a performance target that affects vesting and could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. A reporting entity should apply existing\\nguidance in ASC 718, Compensation\\x97Stock Compensation, as it relates to such awards. ASU 2014-12 is effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2017 with early adoption permitted using either of two methods:\\n(i)\\xa0prospective to all awards granted or modified after the effective date; or (ii)\\xa0retrospective to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial\\nstatements and to all new or modified awards thereafter, with the cumulative effect of applying ASU 2014-12 as an adjustment to the opening retained earnings balance as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial\\nstatements. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption on ASU 2014-12 on our consolidated financial statements. \\nRevenue Recognition:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.\\xa02014-09, Revenue from\\nContracts with Customers: Topic 606 (ASU 2014-09), to supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to\\ncustomers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is possible more judgment and estimates\\nmay be required within the revenue recognition process than required under existing U.S. GAAP including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and\\nallocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 is effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2018 using either of two methods: (i)\\xa0retrospective to each prior reporting period presented with the\\noption to elect \\n \\xa0 101\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May\\xa031, 2014  \\xa0\\n \\ncertain practical expedients as defined within ASU 2014-09; or (ii)\\xa0retrospective with the cumulative effect of initially applying ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of initial application\\nand providing certain additional disclosures as defined per ASU 2014-09.

ASU 2014-08 is effective for us on a prospective basis in our first quarter of fiscal 2016 with early adoption permitted for disposals (or classifications as held for sale)\\nthat have not been reported in financial statements previously issued. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2014-08 on our consolidated financial statements. \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\nACQUISITIONS \\n Proposed Acquisitions of MICROS Systems, Inc. and Others  On June\\xa022, 2014, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement) with MICROS Systems, Inc. (MICROS), a provider of integrated software, hardware and services solutions to the\\nhospitality and retail industries. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we will commence a tender offer for the outstanding shares and shares generally representing vested equity incentive awards of MICROS (collectively, MICROS Shares). MICROS\\nshareholders will have the right to tender their MICROS Shares to Oracle in exchange for $68.00 per share in cash upon consummation of the tender offer. The tender offer will commence no later than ten (10) business days from June\\xa022, 2014.\\nAfter completion of the tender offer and subject to certain limited conditions, MICROS will merge with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oracle. In addition, unvested equity awards to acquire MICROS common stock that are outstanding immediately\\nprior to the conclusion of the merger will generally be converted into equity awards denominated in shares of our common stock based on formulas contained in the Merger Agreement. The estimated total purchase price for MICROS is approximately\\n$5.3\\xa0billion. This transaction is conditioned upon (i)\\xa0at least a majority of the MICROS Shares being validly tendered to Oracle, (ii)\\xa0regulatory clearance under the\\xa0Hart-Scott-Rodino\\xa0Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976,\\n(iii)\\xa0the applicable merger control laws of the European Commission and other jurisdictions, and (iv)\\xa0certain other customary closing conditions.  We also have entered into certain other agreements to acquire other companies and expect these proposed acquisitions to close during the first quarter of fiscal 2015. \\nFiscal 2014 Acquisitions \\nAcquisition of Responsys, Inc.  On\\nFebruary\\xa06, 2014, we completed our acquisition of Responsys, Inc. (Responsys), a provider of enterprise-scale cloud-based business-to-consumer marketing software. We have included the financial results of Responsys in our consolidated financial\\nstatements from the date of acquisition. The total preliminary purchase price for Responsys was approximately $1.6 billion, which consisted of approximately $1.4 billion in cash and $147\\xa0million for the fair value of stock options and\\nrestricted stock-based awards assumed. We have preliminarily recorded $35 million of net tangible liabilities, related primarily to deferred tax liabilities, $580\\xa0million of identifiable intangible assets, and $14 million of in-process research\\nand development, based on their estimated fair values, and $1.0 billion of residual goodwill.

The total purchase price for RightNow was approximately $1.5 billion, which consisted of approximately $1.5 billion in cash and $14\\nmillion for the fair value of stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed. We recorded $697 million of identifiable intangible assets and $259\\xa0million of net tangible liabilities related primarily to customer performance\\nobligations, convertible debt and deferred tax liabilities that were assumed as a part of this acquisition, based on their estimated fair values, and $1.1 billion of residual goodwill.  Acquisition of Pillar Data Systems, Inc.  On July\\xa018, 2011, we acquired Pillar\\nData Systems, Inc. (Pillar Data), a provider of enterprise storage systems solutions. Prior to the acquisition, Pillar Data was directly and indirectly majority-owned and controlled by Lawrence J. Ellison, our Chief Executive Officer, director and\\nlargest stockholder. Pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger dated as of June\\xa029, 2011 (Pillar Data Merger Agreement), we acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Pillar Data from the stockholders in exchange for\\nrights to receive contingent cash consideration (Earn-Out), if any, pursuant to an Earn-Out calculation. An affiliate of Mr.\\xa0Ellison has a preference right to receive the first approximately $565 million of the Earn-Out, if any, and rights to\\n55% of any amount of the Earn-Out that exceeds $565 million.  The Earn-Out will be calculated with respect to a three-year period that\\ncommenced with our second quarter of fiscal 2012 and will conclude with our first quarter of fiscal 2015 (Earn-Out Period). The Earn-Out will be an amount (if positive) calculated based on the product of (i)\\xa0the difference between\\n(x)\\xa0future revenues generated from the sale of certain Pillar Data products during Oracle\\x92s last four full fiscal quarters during the Earn-Out Period minus (y)\\xa0certain losses associated with certain Pillar Data products incurred over\\nthe entire Earn-Out Period, multiplied by (ii)\\xa0three. Our obligation to pay the Earn-Out will be subject to reduction as a result of our right to set-off the amount of any indemnification claims we may have under the Pillar Data Merger\\nAgreement. We do not expect the amount of the Earn-Out or its potential impact will be material to our results of operations or financial position.  We have included the financial results of Pillar Data in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. These results were not material to our consolidated financial statements. The\\nestimated fair value of the liability for contingent consideration as of the acquisition date, representing the purchase price payable for our acquisition of Pillar Data, was approximately $346 million and was included in other non-current\\nliabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Our liability for contingent consideration payable is subject to change until the liability is settled with the related impact recorded to our consolidated statements of operations as acquisition\\nrelated and other expenses. In connection with our acquisition of Pillar Data, we recorded $142 million of identifiable intangible assets and $16 million of net tangible liabilities, based on their estimated fair values, and $220 million of residual\\ngoodwill. As of May\\xa031, 2014 and 2013, we estimated the fair value of the Earn-Out liability to be zero. We recorded a net benefit to acquisition related and other expenses of $387 million in fiscal 2013 to reduce the Earn-Out liability to zero\\nprimarily as a result of a change in our estimate of year three revenues related to our acquisition of Pillar Data and the related impact to the liability calculation in accordance with the Earn-Out formula as noted above. \\nIn June\\xa02014, Mr.\\xa0Ellison agreed to pay to Oracle 95% of all amounts, if any, that are paid to him under the Earn-Out (see Note 18 below for\\nadditional information).  Other Fiscal 2012 Acquisitions  During fiscal 2012, we acquired certain other companies and purchased certain technology and development assets primarily to expand our products and services offerings. These acquisitions were not\\nindividually significant. We have included the financial results of these companies in our consolidated financial statements \\n \\xa0 104\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May\\xa031, 2014  \\xa0\\n \\nfrom their respective acquisition dates and the results from each of these companies were not individually material to our consolidated financial statements. In the aggregate, the total purchase\\nprice for these acquisitions was approximately $1.6 billion, which consisted of approximately $1.6 billion in cash and $5 million for the fair value of stock options assumed. We recorded $540 million of identifiable intangible assets and $29 million\\nof net tangible assets, based on their estimated fair values, and $1.1 billion of residual goodwill.  Unaudited Pro Forma Financial\\nInformation  The unaudited pro forma financial information in the table below summarizes the combined results of operations for Oracle,\\nResponsys, Acme Packet, Eloqua and certain other companies that we acquired since the beginning of fiscal 2013 (which were considered significant for the purposes of unaudited pro forma financial information disclosure) as though the companies were\\ncombined as of the beginning of fiscal 2013. The pro forma financial information for all periods presented also included the business combination accounting effects resulting from these acquisitions including our amortization charges from acquired\\nintangible assets (certain of which were preliminary), stock-based compensation charges for unvested stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed, if any, and the related tax effects as though the aforementioned companies were combined as\\nof the beginning of fiscal 2013. The pro forma financial information as presented below is for informational purposes only and is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the acquisitions had taken place at the\\nbeginning of fiscal 2013.  The unaudited pro forma financial information for fiscal 2014 combined the historical results of Oracle for fiscal\\n2014, the historical results of Responsys for the nine months ended September\\xa030, 2013 (adjusted due to differences in reporting periods and considering the date we acquired Responsys), the historical results of certain other companies that we\\nacquired since the beginning of fiscal 2014 based upon their respective previous reporting periods and the dates these companies were acquired by us, and the effects of the pro forma adjustments listed above. \\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information for fiscal 2013 combined the historical results of Oracle for fiscal 2013, the historical results of\\nResponsys for the twelve months ended June\\xa030, 2013 (due to differences in reporting periods), the historical results of Acme Packet for the year ended December\\xa031, 2012 (adjusted due to differences in reporting periods and considering the\\ndate we acquired Acme Packet), the historical results of Eloqua for the nine months ended September\\xa030, 2012 (adjusted due to differences in reporting periods and considering the date we acquired Eloqua), the historical results of certain other\\ncompanies that we acquired since the beginning of fiscal 2013 based upon their respective previous reporting periods and the dates these companies were acquired by us, and the effects of the pro forma adjustments listed above.

Our investment portfolio is subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. As described above, we limit purchases of marketable debt securities to\\ninvestment grade securities and also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. As stated in our investment policy, we are averse to principal loss and seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk.\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n4.\\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS \\n We perform fair value measurements in accordance with ASC 820. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from\\nselling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at their fair values, we\\nconsider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the assets or liabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of\\nnonperformance.  ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the\\nuse of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. An asset\\x92s or a liability\\x92s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 establishes\\nthree levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Level 2: inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or\\nliabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or\\nliabilities; or  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Level 3: unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair values of the assets or\\nliabilities. \\n \\xa0 106\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May\\xa031, 2014  \\xa0\\n Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis \\nOur assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis, excluding accrued interest components, consisted of the following (Level 1 and 2 inputs are\\ndefined above):  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nMay\\xa031, 2014\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nMay\\xa031, 2013\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nFair\\xa0Value\\xa0MeasurementsUsing\\nInput Types\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nFair\\xa0Value\\xa0MeasurementsUsing\\nInput Types\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n (in millions)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0Level\\xa01\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0Level 2\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0Total\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0Level\\xa01\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0Level 2\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0Total\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Assets:\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Commercial paper debt securities\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\x97\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n7,969\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n7,969\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\x97\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n14,043\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n14,043\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Corporate debt securities and other\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n119\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n16,538\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n16,657\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n246\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n4,689\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n4,935\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Derivative financial instruments\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\x97\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n97\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n97\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\x97\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n41\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n41\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Total assets\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0119\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa024,604\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa024,723\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0246\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa018,773\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa019,019\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n Our valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of our marketable securities that were classified as Level 1 in\\nthe table above were derived from quoted market prices and active markets for these instruments exist.

In connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes, we entered into certain cross-currency swap\\nagreements that have the economic effect of converting our fixed rate, Euro denominated debt, including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a fixed rate, U.S.\\xa0Dollar denominated debt of $1.6 billion with a\\nfixed annual interest rate of 3.53% (see Note 11 for additional information). Further, we designated the 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional\\ncurrency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholders\\x92 equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the U.S. Dollar. Refer to Note 11 for additional information. \\nIn July 2013, we also issued $3.0 billion of senior notes comprised of $500 million of floating rate notes due January 2019 (2019 Floating Rate Notes),\\n$1.5 billion of 2.375% notes due January 2019 (January 2019 Notes) and $1.0 billion of 3.625% \\n \\xa0 109\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May\\xa031, 2014  \\xa0\\n \\nnotes due July 2023 (2023 Notes). The 2019 Floating Rate Notes bear interest at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 0.58% (0.81% as of May\\xa031, 2014) with interest payable\\nquarterly. We issued these senior notes for general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and future acquisitions.  In October 2012, we issued $5.0 billion of fixed rate senior notes comprised of $2.5 billion of 1.20% notes due October 2017 (2017 Notes) and $2.5 billion of 2.50% notes due October 2022 (2022 Notes).\\n In July 2010, we issued $3.25 billion of fixed rate senior notes comprised of $1.0 billion of 3.875% notes due July 2020 (2020 Notes) and\\n$2.25 billion of 5.375% notes due July 2040 (2040 Notes, and together with the 2020 Notes, the Original Senior Notes). As part of the offering of the Original Senior Notes, we entered into a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers\\nfor the benefit of the holders of the Original Senior Notes in which we agreed to file with the SEC a registration statement with respect to senior notes identical in all material respects to the Original Senior Notes within fourteen months after\\nthe issue date of the Original Senior Notes and on December\\xa016, 2011 we completed a registered offer to exchange the Original Senior Notes for new freely tradable notes having terms substantially identical to the Original Senior Notes. An\\naggregate of $994\\xa0million principal amount of the 2020 Notes and an aggregate of $2.24 billion principal amount of the 2040 Notes were tendered and exchanged in the offer.  In July 2009, we issued $4.5 billion of fixed rate senior notes comprised of $1.5 billion of 3.75% notes due July\\xa02014 (2014 Notes), $1.75 billion of 5.00% notes due July 2019 (July 2019 Notes) and\\n$1.25 billion of 6.125% notes due July 2039 (2039 Notes).  In April 2008, we issued $5.0 billion of fixed rate senior notes, of which $1.25\\nbillion of 4.95% senior notes was due and paid in April 2013, and $2.5 billion of 5.75% senior notes due April 2018 (2018 Notes) and $1.25 billion of 6.50% senior notes due April 2038 (2038 Notes) remained outstanding as of May\\xa031, 2014.\\n In January 2006, we issued $5.75 billion of senior notes, of which $2.25 billion of 5.00% senior notes was due and paid in January 2011 and\\n$2.0 billion of 5.25% senior notes due January 2016 (2016 Notes) remained outstanding as of May\\xa031, 2014.  The effective interest yields\\nof the 2014 Notes, 2016 Notes, 2017 Notes, 2018 Notes, January 2019 Notes, July\\xa02019 Notes, 2020 Notes, 2022 Notes, 2023 Notes, 2025 Notes, 2038 Notes, 2039 Notes and 2040 Notes (collectively and together with the 2021 Notes, the Senior Notes)\\nat May\\xa031, 2014 were 3.75%, 5.32%, 1.24%, 5.76%, 2.44%, 5.05%, 3.93%, 2.51%, 3.73%, 3.17%, 6.52%, 6.19% and 5.45%, respectively. In July 2013, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the\\nfixed interest obligations associated with the January 2019 Notes so that the interest payable on these notes effectively became variable (0.88% at May\\xa031, 2014; see Note 11 for additional information). In September 2009, we entered into\\ncertain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with the 2014 Notes so that the interest payable on these notes effectively became variable (1.29% at May\\xa031, 2014; see\\nNote 11 for additional information). The effective interest yield of the 2021 Notes was 2.33% (3.53% after the economic effects of the cross-currency swap agreements described above and in Note 11). Interest is payable semi-annually for the Senior\\nNotes except for the 2021 Notes and 2025 Notes for which interest is payable annually. We may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes of each series at any time, subject to payment of an applicable make-whole premium. The 2019 Floating Rate Notes may\\nnot be redeemed prior to their maturity.  The Senior Notes and the 2019 Floating Rate Notes rank pari passu with any other notes we may issue\\nin the future pursuant to our commercial paper program (see additional discussion regarding our commercial paper program below) and all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness of Oracle Corporation. All existing and future liabilities of\\nthe subsidiaries of Oracle Corporation are or will be effectively senior to the Senior Notes and the 2019 Floating Rate Notes and any future issuances of commercial paper notes.

As of May\\xa031, 2014 and 2013, we\\ndid not have any outstanding commercial paper notes. We intend to back-stop any commercial paper notes that we may issue in the future with the 2013 Credit Agreement (see additional details below). \\nRevolving Credit Agreements  In April\\n2013, we entered into a $3.0 billion Revolving Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Bank of America, N.A., BNP Paribas, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and certain other lenders (the 2013 Credit Agreement). The 2013 Credit Agreement provides for\\nan unsecured 5-year revolving credit facility to be used for general corporate purposes including back-stopping any commercial paper notes that we may issue. Subject to certain conditions stated in the 2013 Credit Agreement, we may borrow, prepay\\nand re-borrow amounts under the 2013 Credit Agreement at any time during the term of the 2013 Credit Agreement. Interest under the 2013 Credit Agreement is based on either (a)\\xa0a LIBOR-based formula or (b)\\xa0the Base Rate formula, each as set\\nforth in the 2013 Credit Agreement. Any amounts drawn pursuant to the 2013 Credit Agreement are due on April\\xa020, 2018.\\xa0No amounts were outstanding pursuant to the 2013 Credit Agreement as of May\\xa031, 2014 and 2013. \\nThe 2013 Credit Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default, including the requirement that our\\ntotal net debt to total capitalization ratio not exceed 45% on a consolidated basis. If any of the events of default occur and are not cured within applicable grace periods or waived, any unpaid amounts under the 2013 Credit Agreement may be\\ndeclared immediately due and payable and the 2013 Credit Agreement may be terminated. We were in compliance with the 2013 Credit Agreement\\x92s covenants as of May\\xa031, 2014.  On May\\xa029, 2012, we borrowed $1.7 billion pursuant to a revolving credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as initial lender and administrative agent; and J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC, as sole\\nlead arranger and sole bookrunner (the 2012 Credit Agreement). During fiscal 2013, we repaid the $1.7 billion and the 2012 Credit Agreement expired pursuant to its terms.  On May\\xa027, 2011, we entered into two revolving credit agreements with BNP Paribas, as initial lender and administrative agent, and BNP Paribas Securities Corp., as sole lead arranger and sole\\nbookrunner (the 2011 Credit Agreements), and borrowed $1.15 billion pursuant to these agreements. During fiscal 2012, we repaid the $1.15 billion and the 2011 Credit Agreements expired pursuant to their terms. \\n \\xa0 111\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May\\xa031, 2014  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n9.\\nRESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES \\n Fiscal 2013 Oracle Restructuring Plan  During the first quarter of fiscal 2013, our management approved, committed to and initiated plans to restructure and further improve efficiencies in our operations (the 2013 Restructuring Plan). Our\\nmanagement subsequently amended the 2013 Restructuring Plan in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 and in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 to reflect additional actions that we expect to take. The total estimated restructuring costs associated with the\\n2013 Restructuring Plan are $705 million and will be recorded to the restructuring expense line item within our consolidated statements of operations as they are incurred. We recorded $174 million and $325 million of restructuring expenses in\\nconnection with the 2013 Restructuring Plan in fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively, and we expect to incur the majority of the estimated remaining $206 million through the end of fiscal 2015. Any changes to the estimates of executing the 2013\\nRestructuring Plan will be reflected in our future results of operations.  Sun Restructuring Plan \\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2010, our management approved, committed to and initiated a plan to restructure our operations due to our acquisition\\nof Sun Microsystems, Inc. (the Sun Restructuring Plan) in order to improve the cost efficiencies in our merged operations. Restructuring costs associated with the Sun Restructuring Plan were recorded to the restructuring expense line item within our\\nconsolidated statements of operations as they were recognized.

updates and product support revenues and deferred hardware systems support revenues represent\\ncustomer payments made in advance for support contracts that are typically billed on a per annum basis in advance with corresponding revenues being recognized ratably over the support periods. Deferred services revenues include prepayments for our\\nservices business and revenues for these services are generally recognized as the services are performed. Deferred cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues typically result from our cloud-based offerings that are typically billed in advance and recognized\\nover the corresponding contractual term. Deferred new software licenses revenues typically result from undelivered products or specified enhancements, customer specific acceptance provisions, customer payments made in advance for time-based license\\narrangements and software license transactions that cannot be segmented from undelivered consulting or other services.  In connection with our\\nacquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the cloud SaaS and PaaS, software license updates and product support, and hardware systems support obligations, amongst others, assumed from our acquired companies. We generally have estimated the\\nfair values of these obligations assumed using a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. The sum of the costs and operating\\nprofit approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume these acquired obligations. These aforementioned fair value adjustments recorded for obligations assumed from our acquisitions reduced the cloud SaaS\\nand PaaS, software license updates and product support and hardware systems support deferred revenues balances that we recorded as liabilities from these acquisitions and also reduced the resulting revenues that we recognized or will recognize over\\nthe terms of the acquired obligations during the post-combination periods.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n11.\\nDERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\n Fair Value Hedges\\x97Interest Rate Swap Agreements  In July 2013, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with our January 2019 Notes so that the interest\\npayable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. In September 2009, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with our 2014\\nNotes so that the interest payable on these notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. The critical terms of the interest rate swap agreements and the January 2019 Notes and 2014 Notes that the interest rate swap agreements pertain to match,\\nincluding the notional amounts and maturity dates.  We have designated the aforementioned interest rate swap agreements as qualifying hedging\\ninstruments and are accounting for them as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815.

The changes\\nin fair values of these interest rate swap agreements are recognized as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amounts included in prepaid expenses and other current assets or other current liabilities\\nfor the 2014 Notes, and other assets or other non-current liabilities for the January 2019 Notes in our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of net gain (loss) attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized as interest expense in our\\nconsolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amount included in notes payable, current and other current borrowings for the 2014 Notes, and notes payable and other non-current borrowings for the January 2019 Notes. The periodic\\ninterest settlements for the interest rate swap agreements for the 2014 Notes and January 2019 Notes are recorded as interest expense.  We do\\nnot use any interest rate swap agreements for trading purposes.  Cash Flow Hedges\\x97Cross Currency Swap Agreements\\n In connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes, we entered into certain cross-currency swap agreements to manage the related foreign\\ncurrency exchange risk by effectively converting the fixed-rate, Euro denominated 2021 Notes, including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to fixed-rate, U.S.\\xa0Dollar denominated debt. The economic effect of\\nthe swap agreements was to eliminate the uncertainty of the cash flows in U.S. Dollars associated with the 2021 Notes by fixing the principal amount of the 2021 Notes at $1.6 billion with a fixed annual interest rate of 3.53%. We have designated\\nthese cross-currency swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for these as cash flow hedges pursuant to ASC 815. The critical terms of the cross-currency swap agreements correspond to the 2021 Notes, including the annual\\ninterest payments being hedged, and the cross-currency swap agreements mature at the same time as the 2021 Notes.  We used the hypothetical\\nderivative method to measure the effectiveness of our cross-currency swap agreements. The fair values of these cross-currency swap agreements are recognized as other assets or other non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The\\neffective portions of the changes in fair values of these cross-currency swap agreements are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets and an amount is reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive\\nloss into non-operating (expense) income, net in the same period that the carrying value of the Euro denominated 2021 Notes is remeasured and the interest expense is recognized. The ineffective portion of the unrealized gains and losses on these\\ncross-currency swaps, if any, is recorded immediately to non-operating (expense) income, net. We evaluate the effectiveness of our cross-currency swap agreements on a quarterly basis. We did not record any ineffectiveness during fiscal 2014.\\n We do not use any cross-currency swap agreements for trading purposes.  Net Investment Hedge\\x97Foreign Currency Borrowings  In July 2013, we designated\\nour Euro denominated 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholders\\x92 equity caused by the\\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the U.S. Dollar.  We used the spot method to measure the effectiveness\\nof our net investment hedge. Under this method, for each reporting period, the change in the carrying value of the Euro denominated 2025 Notes due to remeasurement of the effective portion is reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our\\nconsolidated balance sheet and the remaining change in the carrying value of the ineffective portion, if any, is recognized in non-operating (expense) income, net in our consolidated statements of operations. We evaluate the effectiveness of our net\\ninvestment hedge at the beginning of every quarter. We did not record any ineffectiveness during fiscal 2014. \\n \\xa0 115\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May\\xa031, 2014  \\xa0\\n Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as Hedges \\nWe transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the\\nrisks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or\\nlosses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions. We may suspend this program from time to time. Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from\\nintercompany sublicense fees, intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions that are generally expected to be cash settled in the near term. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. Our ultimate realized\\ngain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency exposures that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized\\nand unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors.  We neither use these foreign\\ncurrency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815. Accordingly, we recorded the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our\\nconsolidated balance sheet with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statement of operations. The balance sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is prepaid expenses and other current assets for a net\\nunrealized gain position and other current liabilities for a net unrealized loss position. The statement of operations classification for changes in fair values of these forward contracts is non-operating (expense) income, net, for both realized and\\nunrealized gains and losses.  As of May\\xa031, 2014 and 2013, respectively, the notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase\\nU.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $3.6 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, and the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were\\n$2.0 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal at May\\xa031, 2014 and 2013.  Included in our non-operating (expense) income, net were $(69) million, $(64) million and $43 million of net (losses) gains related to these forward contracts for the years ended May\\xa031, 2014, 2013\\nand 2012, respectively.

We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for our hardware products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished hardware products. We also obtain\\nindividual components for our hardware systems products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically\\nprovide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead-times and/or commercially standard lead-times for the particular part or product and have been included in the amounts below. Routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to\\nour external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in the ordinary course of business are not included in the amounts below as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are\\ndifficult to quantify in a meaningful way.

Guarantees  Our software and hardware systems product sales agreements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if our products infringe a third party\\x92s intellectual\\nproperty rights. To date, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications and have not accrued any material liabilities related to such obligations in our consolidated financial statements. Certain of our product sales\\nagreements also include provisions indemnifying customers against liabilities in the event we breach confidentiality or service level requirements. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements\\ndue to our limited and infrequent history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.  Our software license and hardware systems products agreements also generally include a warranty that our products will substantially operate as described in the applicable program documentation for a\\nperiod of one year after delivery. We also warrant that services we perform will be provided in a manner consistent with industry standards for a period of 90 days from performance of the service. \\nWe occasionally are required, for various reasons, to enter into\\xa0financial guarantees with third parties in\\xa0the ordinary course of our\\nbusiness\\xa0including, among others,\\xa0guarantees related to foreign exchange trades, taxes, import licenses and letters of credit on behalf of parties with whom we conduct business.

Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time\\nthrough open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.  Dividends on Common Stock  During fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, our Board of Directors\\ndeclared cash dividends of $0.48, $0.30 and $0.24 per share of our outstanding common stock, respectively, which we paid during the same period. \\nIn June 2014, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per share of our outstanding common stock payable on July\\xa030, 2014\\nto stockholders of record as of the close of business on July\\xa09, 2014.

In fiscal 2014, our stockholders, upon the recommendation of our Board of Directors, approved a further\\nincrease in the number of authorized shares of stock that may be issued under the 2000 Plan by 305,000,000 shares. Under the terms of the 2000 Plan, options to purchase common stock are granted at not less than fair market value, become exercisable\\nas established by the Board (generally 25% annually over four years under our current practice) and generally expire no more than ten years from the date of grant. As of May\\xa031, 2014, options to purchase 448\\xa0million shares of common stock\\nwere outstanding under the 2000 Plan, of which 183\\xa0million were vested. As of May\\xa031, 2014, approximately 495\\xa0million shares of common stock were available for future awards under the 2000 Plan. To date, we have not issued any stock\\npurchase rights, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock-based awards or long-term performance awards under the 2000 Plan.  In fiscal 1993,\\nthe Board adopted the 1993 Directors\\x92 Stock Option Plan (the Directors\\x92 Plan), which provides for the issuance of non-qualified stock options to non-employee directors. The Directors\\x92 Plan has from time to time been amended and\\nrestated. Under the terms of the Directors\\x92 Plan, options to purchase 10\\xa0million shares of common stock were reserved for issuance (including a fiscal 2013 amendment to increase the number of shares of our common stock reserved for\\nissuance by 2\\xa0million shares), options are granted at not less than fair market value, become exercisable over four years and expire no more than ten years from the date of grant. The Directors\\x92 Plan provides for automatic grants of\\noptions to each non-employee director upon first becoming a director and thereafter on an annual basis, as well as automatic nondiscretionary grants for chairing or vice chairing certain Board committees. The Board will determine the particular\\nterms of any such stock awards at the time of grant, but the terms will be consistent with those of options granted under the Directors\\x92 Plan with respect to vesting or forfeiture schedules and treatment on termination of status as a director.\\nAs of May\\xa031, 2014, options to purchase approximately 3\\xa0million shares of common stock were outstanding under the 1993 Directors\\x92 Plan, of which approximately 2\\xa0million were vested. As of May\\xa031, 2014, approximately\\n2\\xa0million shares were available for future option awards under this plan.  In connection with certain of our acquisitions, we assumed\\ncertain outstanding stock options and other restricted stock-based awards of each acquiree\\x92s respective stock plans.

Changes in the input assumptions\\ncan materially affect the fair value estimates and ultimately how much we recognize as stock-based compensation expense. The fair values of our stock options were estimated at the grant dates or at the acquisition dates for options assumed in a\\nbusiness combination.

Tax Benefits from Exercise of Stock Options and Vesting of Restricted Stock-Based Awards \\nTotal cash received as a result of option exercises was approximately $2.0 billion, $1.4 billion and $622 million for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012,\\nrespectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised and vesting of restricted stock-based awards was $1.5 billion, $1.3 billion and $587 million for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In connection with these exercises and\\nvesting of restricted stock-based awards, the tax benefits realized by us were $480 million, $410 million and $182 million for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan \\nWe have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (Purchase Plan) that allows employees to purchase shares of common stock at a price per share that is 95% of the\\nfair market value of Oracle stock as of the end of the semi-annual option period. As of May\\xa031, 2014, 60\\xa0million shares were reserved for future issuances under the Purchase Plan. We issued 3\\xa0million shares under the Purchase Plan in\\neach of fiscal 2014 and 2013 and 4\\xa0million shares in fiscal 2012.  Defined Contribution and Other Postretirement Plans \\nWe offer various defined contribution plans for our U.S. and non-U.S. employees. Total defined contribution plan expense was $357 million, $353 million\\nand $344 million for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The number of plan participants in our benefit plans has generally increased in recent years primarily as a result of additional eligible employees from our acquisitions. \\nIn the United States, regular employees can participate in the Oracle Corporation 401(k) Savings and Investment Plan (Oracle 401(k) Plan). Participants\\ncan generally contribute up to 40% of their eligible compensation on a per-pay-period basis as defined by the Oracle 401(k) Plan document or by the section 402(g) limit as defined by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS). We match a\\nportion of employee contributions, currently 50% up to 6% of compensation each pay period, subject to maximum aggregate matching amounts. Our contributions to the Oracle 401(k) Plan, net of forfeitures, were $134 million, $129 million and $125\\nmillion in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.  We also offer non-qualified deferred compensation plans to certain key employees whereby\\nthey may defer a portion of their annual base and/or variable compensation until retirement or a date specified by the employee in accordance with the plans. Deferred compensation plan assets and liabilities were each approximately $367\\xa0million\\nas of May\\xa031, 2014 and were each approximately $320 million as of May\\xa031, 2013 and were presented in other assets and other non-current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. \\nWe sponsor certain defined benefit pension plans that are offered primarily by certain of our foreign subsidiaries. Many of these plans were assumed\\nthrough our acquisitions or are required by local regulatory requirements. We may deposit funds for these plans with insurance companies, third party trustees, or into government-managed accounts consistent with local regulatory requirements, as\\napplicable. Our total defined benefit plan pension expenses were $64 million, $81 million and $55 million for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The aggregate projected benefit obligation and aggregate net liability (funded status) of our\\ndefined benefit plans as of May\\xa031, 2014 was $853 million and $436 million, respectively, and as of

taxes on the undistributed earnings and the other outside basis temporary differences\\nof foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. During the third quarter of fiscal 2012, we increased the number of foreign subsidiaries in countries with lower statutory rates than the United\\nStates, the earnings of which we consider to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States.\\xa0If these subsidiaries generate sufficient earnings in the future, our provision for income taxes may continue to be favorably affected to a\\nmeaningful extent, although any such favorable effects could be significantly reduced under a variety of circumstances. At May\\xa031, 2014, the amount of temporary differences related to undistributed earnings and other outside basis temporary\\ndifferences of investments in foreign subsidiaries upon which United States income taxes have not been provided was approximately $32.4 billion and $6.9 billion, respectively. If these undistributed earnings were repatriated to the United States, or\\nif the other outside basis differences were recognized in a taxable transaction, they would generate foreign tax credits that would reduce the federal tax liability associated with the foreign dividend or the otherwise taxable transaction. At\\nMay\\xa031, 2014, assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits, the potential net deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences of undistributed earnings and other outside basis temporary differences would be\\napproximately $10.0 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively.  Our net deferred tax assets were $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion as of May\\xa031,\\n2014 and 2013, respectively. We believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generation of sufficient taxable income\\nin future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating \\n \\xa0 125\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May\\xa031, 2014  \\xa0\\n \\nloss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income\\nchange.  The valuation allowance was $1.1 billion and $999 million at May\\xa031, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Substantially all of the\\nvaluation allowances as of May\\xa031, 2014 and 2013 relate to tax assets established in purchase accounting. Any subsequent reduction of that portion of the valuation allowance and the recognition of the associated tax benefits associated with our\\nacquisitions will be recorded to our provision for income taxes subsequent to our final determination of the valuation allowance or the conclusion of the measurement period (as defined above), whichever comes first. \\nAt May\\xa031, 2014, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1.0 billion. These losses expire in various years between fiscal\\n2016 and fiscal 2033, and are subject to limitations on their utilization. We had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $2.8 billion at May\\xa031, 2014, which expire between fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2033, and are subject to\\nlimitations on their utilization. We had total foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1.8 billion at May\\xa031, 2014, which are subject to limitations on their utilization. Approximately $1.7 billion of these foreign net\\noperating losses are not currently subject to expiration dates. The remainder of the foreign net operating losses, approximately $143 million, expire between fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2034. We had tax credit carryforwards of approximately $1.1 billion\\nat May\\xa031, 2014, which are subject to limitations on their utilization. Approximately $614 million of these tax credit carryforwards are not currently subject to expiration dates. The remainder of the tax credit carryforwards, approximately\\n$478 million, expire in various years between fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2033.  We classify our unrecognized tax benefits as either current or\\nnon-current income taxes payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The aggregate changes in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits, including acquisitions, were as follows: \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nYear\\xa0Ended\\xa0May\\xa031,\\n\\xa0\\n\\n (in millions)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2014\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2013\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2012\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Gross unrecognized tax benefits as of June\\xa01\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n3,601\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n3,276\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n3,160\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Increases related to tax positions from prior fiscal years\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n94\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n279\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n99\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Decreases related to tax positions from prior fiscal years\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(116\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(125\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(169\\n)\\xa0\\n\\n Increases related to tax positions taken during current fiscal year\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n307\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n312\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n522\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n Settlements with tax authorities\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(2\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(71\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(187\\n)\\xa0\\n\\n Lapses of statutes of limitation\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(53\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(71\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(84\\n)\\xa0\\n\\n Other, net\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n7\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n1\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(65\\n)\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Total gross unrecognized tax benefits as of May\\xa031\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa03,838\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa03,601\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa03,276\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n As of May\\xa031, 2014, $2.6 billion of unrecognized benefits would affect our effective tax rate if recognized. We\\nrecognized interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our provision for income taxes line of our consolidated statements of operations of $24 million, $31 million and $46 million during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.\\nInterest and penalties accrued as of May\\xa031, 2014 and 2013 were $693 million and $666 million, respectively.  Domestically, U.S. federal\\nand state taxing authorities are currently examining income tax returns of Oracle and various acquired entities for years through fiscal 2013. Many issues are at an advanced stage in the examination process, the most significant of which include the\\ndeductibility of certain royalty payments, transfer pricing, extraterritorial income exemptions, domestic production activity, foreign tax credits, and research and development credits taken. Other issues are related to years with expiring statutes\\nof limitation. With all of these domestic audit issues considered in the aggregate, we believe it was reasonably possible that, as of May\\xa031, 2014, the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to these audits could decrease (whether by payment,\\nrelease, or a \\n \\xa0 126\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May\\xa031, 2014  \\xa0\\n \\ncombination of both) in the next 12 months by as much as $460 million ($364 million net of offsetting tax benefits). Our U.S. federal and, with some exceptions, our state income tax returns have\\nbeen examined for all years prior to fiscal 2003 and we are no longer subject to audit for those periods.  Internationally, tax authorities for\\nnumerous non-U.S. jurisdictions are also examining returns affecting our unrecognized tax benefits. We believe it was reasonably possible that, as of May\\xa031, 2014, the gross unrecognized tax benefits, could decrease (whether by payment,\\nrelease, or a combination of both) by as much as $190 million ($142 million net of offsetting tax benefits) in the next 12 months, related primarily to transfer pricing. Other issues are related to years with expiring statutes of limitation. With\\nsome exceptions, we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations in non-U.S. jurisdictions for years prior to fiscal 1997.  We believe\\nthat we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcomes related to our tax audits and that any settlement will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. However, there can be\\nno assurances as to the possible outcomes.  We previously negotiated three successive unilateral Advance Pricing Agreements with the IRS that\\ncover many of our intercompany transfer pricing issues and preclude the IRS from making a transfer pricing adjustment within the scope of these agreements. These agreements were effective for fiscal years through May\\xa031, 2006. We have reached\\nfinal agreement with the IRS for renewal of this Advance Pricing Agreement for the years ending May\\xa031, 2007 through May\\xa031, 2013. However, these agreements do not cover substantial elements of our transfer pricing and do not bind tax\\nauthorities outside the United States. We have finalized bilateral Advance Pricing Agreements, which are effective for the years ending May\\xa031, 2004 through May\\xa031, 2006 and May\\xa031, 2007 through May\\xa031, 2013. \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n16.\\nSEGMENT INFORMATION \\n ASC 280, Segment Reporting, establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. Operating segments are\\ndefined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing\\nperformance. Our chief operating decision maker is our Chief Executive Officer. We are organized geographically and by line of business. While our Chief Executive Officer evaluates results in a number of different ways, the line of business\\nmanagement structure is the primary basis for which the allocation of resources and financial results are assessed.  During the fourth quarter\\nof fiscal 2014, we added a reportable segment, cloud infrastructure-as-a-service, as a result of the reorganization of financial information presented to our chief operating decision maker for operational decision and resource allocation purposes.\\nAs a result, we reclassified certain revenues and expenses for all periods presented within this note to conform to the current presentation. \\nWe have three businesses\\x97software and cloud, hardware systems and services\\x97which are further divided into certain operating segments. Our\\nsoftware and cloud business is comprised of three operating segments: (1)\\xa0new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions, which includes our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings, (2)\\xa0cloud infrastructure-as-a-service and (3)\\xa0software\\nlicense updates and product support. Our hardware systems business is comprised of two operating segments: (1)\\xa0hardware systems products and (2)\\xa0hardware systems support. All other operating segments are combined under our services\\nbusiness.  The new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions line of business is engaged in the licensing of our database and\\nmiddleware software, as well as our application software, and providing access to a broad range of our software through Oracle Cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings on a subscription basis via a cloud-based IT environment that we manage, host and support.\\n The cloud infrastructure-as-a-service line of business provides deployment and management offerings for our software and hardware and related\\nIT infrastructure including virtual machine instances that are subscription-\\n \\xa0 127\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May\\xa031, 2014  \\xa0\\n \\nbased and designed for computing and reliable and secure object storage; Oracle Engineered Systems hardware and related support that are deployed in our customers\\x92 data centers for a monthly\\nfee; and comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services for customer IT infrastructure for a fee for a stated term that is hosted at our data center facilities, select partner data centers or physically on-premise at\\ncustomer facilities.  The software license updates and product support line of business provides customers with rights to software product\\nupgrades and maintenance releases, patches released, internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel during the support period.  The hardware systems products line of business consists primarily of servers, storage, networking, virtualization software, operating systems including the Oracle Solaris Operating System and management\\nsoftware to support diverse IT environments, including cloud computing environments. As a part of this line of business, we offer our Oracle Engineered Systems, including Oracle Exadata Database Machine, Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud, Oracle\\nExalytics In-Memory Machine, Oracle SuperCluster, Oracle Database Appliance, and Oracle Big Data Appliance, which are the core building blocks for Oracle\\x92s data center and cloud computing products and services. \\nOur hardware systems support line of business provides customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality\\nof our server and storage products, such as Oracle Solaris and certain other software products, and can include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services.  Our services business is comprised of the remainder of our operating segments and offers consulting, advanced customer support services and education services. Our consulting line of business primarily\\nprovides services to customers in business and IT strategy alignment, enterprise architecture planning and design, initial product implementation and integration and ongoing product enhancements and upgrades. Advanced customer support provides\\nsupport services, both on-premise and remote, to our customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their products and services. Education services provide training to customers, partners and employees as a part of our mission\\nof accelerating the adoption and use of our software and hardware products and to create opportunities to grow our product revenues.  We do not\\ntrack our assets by operating segments. Consequently, it is not practical to show assets by operating segment. \\n \\xa0 128\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Trial commenced on November\\xa01, 2010 on the\\nissue of damages, as SAP had stipulated to liability. The jury awarded Oracle $1.3 billion. On September\\xa01, 2011, the court granted the SAP Defendants\\x92 motion for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial. The court vacated the $1.3\\nbillion award and held that Oracle could either accept a reduced amount or remittitur of $272 million or proceed to a new trial. On February\\xa06, 2012, Oracle rejected the remittitur and requested a new trial. \\nOn August\\xa02, 2012, Oracle and the SAP Defendants stipulated to a judgment of $306 million against the SAP Defendants, in lieu of having a second jury\\ntrial, while preserving both parties\\x92 rights to appeal prior court orders. We recorded a $306 million non-current receivable, included in other assets, in our consolidated balance sheet and we recognized a corresponding benefit to our results\\nof operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Previously during trial we received payment of $120 million in attorneys\\x92 fees from SAP under a stipulation, and we recorded this payment upon receipt as a benefit to our results of operations\\nduring the second quarter of fiscal 2011. On August\\xa03, 2012, the court entered the judgment and vacated the date set for the new trial. Oracle filed a Notice of Appeal on August\\xa031, 2012, and the SAP Defendants filed a notice of appeal on\\nSeptember\\xa014, 2012. The SAP Defendants subsequently dismissed their appeal. Oracle\\x92s appeal has been fully briefed. The appellate court heard oral argument on May\\xa013, 2014. The court has not yet ruled on this appeal. \\nHewlett-Packard Company Litigation  On\\nJune\\xa015, 2011, Hewlett-Packard Company (\\x93HP\\x94) filed a complaint in the California Superior Court, County of Santa Clara against Oracle Corporation alleging numerous causes of action including breach of contract, breach of the covenant\\nof good faith and fair dealing, defamation, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, and violation of the California Unfair Business Practices Act. The complaint alleged that when Oracle announced on March\\xa022 and 23, 2011\\nthat it would no longer develop future versions of its software to run on HP\\x92s Itanium-based servers, it breached a settlement agreement signed on September\\xa020, 2010 between HP and Mark Hurd (the \\x93Hurd Settlement Agreement\\x94), who\\nwas both HP\\x92s former chief executive officer and chairman of HP\\x92s board of directors. HP sought a judicial declaration of the parties\\x92 rights and obligations under the Hurd Settlement Agreement, and other equitable and monetary\\nrelief.  Oracle answered the complaint and filed a cross-complaint, which was amended on December\\xa02, 2011. The amended cross-complaint\\nalleged claims including violation of the Lanham Act. Oracle alleged that HP had secretly agreed to pay Intel to continue to develop and manufacture the Itanium microprocessor, and had misrepresented to customers that the Itanium microprocessor had\\na long roadmap, among other claims. Oracle sought equitable rescission of the Hurd Settlement Agreement, and other equitable and monetary relief.  The court bifurcated the trial and tried HP\\x92s causes of action for declaratory relief and promissory estoppel without a jury in June 2012. The court issued a final statement of decision on\\nAugust\\xa028, 2012, finding that the Hurd Settlement Agreement required Oracle to continue to develop certain of its software products for use on HP\\x92s Itanium-based servers and to port such products at no cost to HP for as long as HP sells\\nthose servers. Oracle has announced that it is appealing this decision. The issues of breach, HP\\x92s performance, causation and damages, HP\\x92s tort claims, and Oracle\\x92s cross-claims will all be tried before a jury. As of April\\xa08,\\n2013, the trial is stayed pending Oracle\\x92s appeal of the court\\x92s denial of its anti-SLAPP motion, which is fully briefed, although \\n \\xa0 132\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n ORACLE CORPORATION \\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\x97(Continued)  May\\xa031, 2014  \\xa0\\n \\noral argument has not yet been scheduled. We cannot currently estimate a reasonably possible range of loss for this action. We believe that we have meritorious defenses against this action, and\\nwe will continue to vigorously defend it.  Derivative Litigations and Related Action \\nOn September\\xa030, 2011, a stockholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery and a second stockholder was permitted to\\nintervene as a plaintiff on November\\xa015, 2011. At an August\\xa022, 2012, hearing, the court dismissed certain claims but permitted certain claims for breach of fiduciary duty to proceed. On May\\xa03, 2013, plaintiffs filed an amended\\ncomplaint. The derivative suit is brought by two alleged stockholders of Oracle, purportedly on Oracle\\x92s behalf, against one former director and all but two of our current directors, including against our Chief Executive Officer as an alleged\\ncontrolling stockholder. Plaintiffs allege that Oracle\\x92s directors breached their fiduciary duties in agreeing to purchase Pillar Data Systems, Inc. at an excessive price. Oracle\\x92s acquisition of Pillar is structured as an earn out, under\\nwhich Oracle is scheduled to make a single payment, if any, by November\\xa030, 2014, to Pillar\\x92s former shareholders based on an agreed-upon Earn-Out formula. Plaintiffs seek declaratory relief, rescission of the Pillar Data transaction,\\ndamages, disgorgement of our Chief Executive Officer\\x92s alleged profits, disgorgement of all compensation earned by defendants as a result of their service on Oracle\\x92s Board or any committee of the Board, and an award of attorneys\\x92\\nfees and costs.  On June\\xa013, 2014, plaintiffs and defendants filed a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise, Settlement and Release,\\nunder which our Chief Executive Officer agreed to pay to Oracle 95% of any and all amounts, if any, that are paid to him under the Pillar earn out. Oracle will pay plaintiffs\\x92 attorneys\\x92 fees and costs, which will not exceed $15 million.\\nThe settlement is subject to approval by the Delaware Chancery Court, which has scheduled a fairness hearing for August\\xa012, 2014, at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time.  While the outcome of the derivative litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the outcome will result in losses that are materially in excess of amounts already recognized, if\\nany.  Other Litigation  We\\nare party to various other legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, which arise in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings and claims that relate to acquisitions we have completed or to companies we have acquired\\nor are attempting to acquire. While the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the outcome of any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will result in losses that are materially in excess of\\namounts already recognized, if any. \\n\\n \\xa0 133\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n SCHEDULE II \\nORACLE CORPORATION  VALUATION AND QUALIFYING ACCOUNTS  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n (in millions)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nBeginningBalance\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nAdditionsCharged\\xa0toOperations\\xa0orOther\\xa0Accounts\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nWrite-offs\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nTranslationAdjustmentsandOther\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nEndingBalance\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Allowances for Doubtful Trade Receivables\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Year Ended:\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n May\\xa031, 2012\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n372\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n92\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n(107\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n(34\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n323\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n May\\xa031, 2013\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n323\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n118\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n(167\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n22\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n296\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n May\\xa031, 2014\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n296\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n122\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n(120\\n)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n8\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n306\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n \\xa0 134\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n SIGNATURES \\nPursuant to the requirements of Section\\xa013 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed\\non its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nORACLE CORPORATION\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDate: June\\xa026, 2014\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBy:\\n\\xa0\\n/S/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0LAWRENCE J.
